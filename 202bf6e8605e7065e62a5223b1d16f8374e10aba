      "message": "Hi Wan-Teh,\n\nDuring our code study, we observed that delta angles of directional intra modes were getting evaluated in av1_rd_pick_intra_sby_mode() and av1_handle_intra_y_mode() even when enable_angle_delta was set to 0.\n\nThe enable_angle_delta check in these functions got removed (or not taken care of entirely) in the following CL: \nIntra mode search improvement | https://aomedia-review.googlesource.com/c/aom/+/137725\n\nThis patch disallows the evaluation of delta angles in these functions when enable_angle_delta is configured to 0.\n\nWe have done some sanity verification to ensure that this CL produces bit-exact output for good, rt and allintra encoding modes with the default settings.\n\nPlease review.\n\nRegards,\nJayasanker.",
