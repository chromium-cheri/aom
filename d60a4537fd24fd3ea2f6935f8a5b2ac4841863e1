I have reviewed it carefully.\n\nPatchset 15 contains my edits and was uploaded by me. So my Code-Review+2 doesn\u0027t count.\n\nIf you trust my review of patchset 13, you just need to review the diffs between patchsets 13 and 15:\nhttps://aomedia-review.googlesource.com/c/aom/+/166441/13..15\n\nThank you.",
