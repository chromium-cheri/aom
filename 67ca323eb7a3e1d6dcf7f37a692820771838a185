      "message": "Hi Lester, Yunqing,\nWe have submitted a CL to add SSE4.1 intrinsic optimization for Bi-cubic grad interpolation function for low-bd. We also take care of refactoring C implementation of Bi-Cubic and Bi-Linear filters which is required for intrinsic coding. To validate the intrinsic a unit test framework is also added.\nFor this patch, we observed ~12% encode time reduction for fourpeople_720p60.y4m, speed 1.\n\nPlease check the block level scaling,\nBlock size   Scaling w.r.t C\n  8X8          1.68\n  16X16        2.36\n  32X32        3.73\n  64X64        8.03\n  128X128      19.35\n\nPlease review the patch. \nThank you.\n\nRegards,\nAkshata",
