      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\n\nWhile benchmarking force_large_partition_blocks_intra speed feature we observed that it is not meeting trade-off criteria for low-res and mid-res of speed 9. Hence this CL disables the sf for low-res and mid-res of speed 9. Please note that by default this sf is disabled for hd-res of speed 9.\nPlease check the resolution-wise speed and quality results as mentioned below. \n\n                    Instruction Count        BD-Rate Loss(%)      \ncpu-used Resolution   Reduction(%)    avg.psnr   ovr.psnr    ssim \n   9        rtc         -0.160        -0.0949    -0.2678   -0.2712\n   9      rtc_derf      -0.357        -0.2139    -0.3602   -0.5249\n   9      Average       -0.256        -0.1444    -0.3063   -0.3769\n\nIn the commit message :   \n[-] sign indicates encode time increase \n[+] sign indicates encode time reduction \nThe instruction count reduction specified has been measured using command:\n$ perf stat -e instructions:u ./aomenc â€¦\n\nPlease review the patch.\nThank you.",
