      "message": "Sorry for reviewing late. I was busy on resolving the enc/dec mismatch.\nDo we really need a bit to enable/disable intraBC?  Comparing enabling it by default when \"allow_screen_content_tools\" is on, the bit actually allows disabling intrabc. May I know the benefit of disabling it?  how about allow it always on when \"screen tools is allowed\"?",

      "message": "Current scheme is to support intrabc when screen tools are allowed. This flag signals if intrabc is actually ever used in current frame. For example, the case can be: we consider intrabc during encoding, but it\u0027s never selected as the final mode. We can use this flag to decide if in-loop filters should be disabled: https://aomedia-review.googlesource.com/c/aom/+/31902. We shouldn\u0027t disable in-loop filters when screen tools are allowed but intrabc is not used, e.g. only palette is used.",
