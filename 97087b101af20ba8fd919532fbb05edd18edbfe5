This CL also removes an unused macro TX_SIZE_RD_RECORD_BUFFER_LEN.\n\nFor libaom AV1 video encode, bit-match is verified (w.r.t. parent commit) for \u0027GOOD\u0027, \u0027RT\u0027 and \u0027ALLINTRA\u0027 encoding modes for a few contents with different encoding configurations. It was also verified that the output of AVIF encode is bit-exact w.r.t. parent version for a typical image dataset.\n\nPlease review the patch.\n\nThanks \u0026 Regards,\nVenkata.\n",
