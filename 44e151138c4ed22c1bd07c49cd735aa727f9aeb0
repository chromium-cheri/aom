      "message": "The structure `CdefSearchCtx` holds the buffers required during CDEF search. In the parent commit, these buffers were allocated and deallocated locally within `av1_cdef_search()`. In the event of an early termination during CDEF search, these allocated buffers would not be freed and would result in memory leaks. This CL refactors the above-mentioned buffer allocations by introducing a pointer to the `CdefSearchCtx` structure in `AV1_COMP`. This will facilitate the deallocation of the CDEF search context buffers in `encoder_destroy()` thereby preventing any possible leaks. Also, `CHECK_MEM_ERROR()` is now used for allocating the CDEF search context buffers in `cdef_alloc_data()`.\n\nThis change is bit-exact and has been verified using bitstream-match tests for a combination of various configuration values for --threads, --tile-rows, --tile-columns, --cpu-used, --end-usage, --row-mt, --fp-mt, etc.",
