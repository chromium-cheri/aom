      "message": "Well spotted, but I\u0027m not sure this is the right fix. The problem seems to be that the memcpy() calls below are again hard-coding that TX units are half an MI block. This obviously does the wrong thing when mi_width or mi_height is 1, but I think there will also be problems when select_tx_block() and txfm_partition_update() access these arrays with other sizes, or have I misunderstood?",
