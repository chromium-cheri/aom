      "message": "Hi Marco, Yunqing,\n\nIn av1_cdef_search(), CDEF strengths that would be used at block level are found through R-D optimization. CDEF strengths that would be used at block level are signaled using at most 3 bits. However the number of joint strength combinations (across luma and chroma) can be limited based on cdef_pick_method. When cdef_pick_method\u003dCDEF_FAST_SEARCH_LVL5, the number of joint strength combinations is limited to 4 which can be represented using 2 bits. In this CL, the redundant RD evaluation is avoided for the case of 3 bits. \n\nPlease check the borg results for rtc test-set below. \n```\n                Instruction Count            BD-Rate Loss(%)\ncpu Resolution   Reduction(%)         avg.psnr ovr.psnr   ssim\n 7         rtc       0.383             0.0000   0.0000   0.0000\n 7   rtc_1080p       0.368             0.0000   0.0000   0.0000\n 8         rtc       0.518             0.0000   0.0000   0.0000\n 8   rtc_1080p       0.523             0.0000   0.0000   0.0000\n 9   rtc_1080p       0.593             0.0000   0.0000   0.0000\n10   rtc_1080p       0.605             0.0000   0.0000   0.0000\n```\n\nThe instruction count reduction specified has been measured using command:\n $ perf stat -e instructions:u ./aomenc â€¦\n\nWe also verified for a few contents and speed settings that CL produces bit-exact output for --good usage.\n\nPlease review the CL. \n\nRegards,\nRanjit",
