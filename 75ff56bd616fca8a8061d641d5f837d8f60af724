      "message": "Can you check the behavior with this revision Sai re the issue you identified.\n\nIt is still likely that the change will cause slight visual regression on some images, especially at very low rates but it is a balance of gain vs loss and seems less of a problem at lower speed settings. If need be we can add some sort of Q threshold as well though I am slightly wary of this. Also, for still images we will generally be concerned with quite high quality settings where I don\u0027t think there will be a problem.",

      "message": "I just ran an example (so I may be wrong), in speed 1 and I feel like the threshold is more related to block qp value and the source variance. (for example it looks better even in speed 6 for low qp or high variance blocks)",

      "message": "Certainly it is likely to be the case that the negative cases are less likely at low QP so perhaps we could get away with a higher threshold. At the moment the threshold (or on/off decision) is defined only by the speed setting, as this impacts the set of alternate modes available. We could consider working QP in as another factor in the decision and weighting. As with all these things, especially where visual comparisons are concerned, the issue is the time taken to test and compare variations,",
