      "message": "Maybe it would be better to just remove OD_LOG_BSIZE0 and OD_NBSIZES and set OD_LOG_BSIZE_MAX and OD_BSIZE_MAX to MAX_SB_SIZE_LOG2 and MAX_SB_SIZE? Otherwise it may get confusing since AV1 has more non-square block sizes. From some quick grepping I don\u0027t think that breaks anything.",
