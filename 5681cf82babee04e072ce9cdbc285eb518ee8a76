      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\nDuring our code study we have identified that 2 pixel lines are sufficient for line buffer used in CDEF filtering. Because primary and secondary stages of CDEF uses 4-tap filter. Hence, this patch will reduce CDEF_VBORDER to 2 pixel lines.\n\nThe change is bit-exact (verified locally). Please review the same and let us know your thoughts.\nThank you.",

      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\n\nWith reference to the following link \u0027http://aomedia.org/av1/specification/decoding/#cdef-filter-process\u0027 in spec, the lookup tables \u0027Cdef_Pri_Taps\u0027 and \u0027Cdef_Sec_Taps\u0027 have coefficients for primary and secondary filters respectively. Each lookup table has two set of coefficients and each set is selected based on filter strength. As CDEF is a non-linear filter with symmetric tap coefficients, only coefficients on one side (i.e. 2-taps) of the filter are mentioned in the table.\n\nThe spatial positions of primary and secondary filter taps are specified in lookup table \u0027Cdef_Directions\u0027. As per the table, filter taps can go upto 2 samples in all four directions w.r.t the sample to be filtered. Hence, for CDEF filtering maximum of 2 sample rows/columns are required.\n\nThank you.",
