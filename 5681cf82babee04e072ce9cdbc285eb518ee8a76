      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\nDuring our code study we have identified that 2 pixel lines are sufficient for line buffer used in CDEF filtering. Because primary and secondary stages of CDEF uses 4-tap filter. Hence, this patch will reduce CDEF_VBORDER to 2 pixel lines.\n\nThe change is bit-exact (verified locally). Please review the same and let us know your thoughts.\nThank you.",
