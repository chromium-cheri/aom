      "message": "Note that the word \"done\" is used with two meanings in this function.\n\n1. In the comment at line 82, \"done\" means the `execute(worker)` call is done.\n\n2. In this line, the `done` variable means the woker should exit its `thread_loop()` function.\n\nIn a future CL, I will replace the `done` variable with a `break` statement. So we don\u0027t need to address this potential confusion now.",
