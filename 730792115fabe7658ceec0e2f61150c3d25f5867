      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\nIn this CL, we have introduced a speed feature ‘skip_filter_intra_in_inter_frames’ to speed-up RTC encoding.\nThe speed feature skips filter intra mode evaluation in inter frames if rd evaluation of luma dc mode results in invalid rd stats and rd_stats_y-\u003erate would have been set to INT_MAX in this case. \nWhen we tried further aggressive pruning using best_rd_so_far and best_rd, the incremental speed-up we got was lesser with more quality drop. Hence we used the pruning logic as in the current CL.\n\nThis patch is applicable for --rt, speed 5 and 6 and has no effect for other presets.\n\nPlease find the Borg results below.\n\n                     Instruction Count     BD-Rate Loss(%)\ncpu-used  Resolution   Reduction(%)     avg.psnr  ovr.psnr   ssim  \n  5        rtc             5.276     \t 0.0505   0.0393    0.0157   \n  5   \trtc_derf           5.493     \t 0.0534   0.0563    0.0107    \n  5      Average           5.382     \t 0.0517   0.0464    0.0136   \n  6        rtc             3.472     \t 0.0498   0.0575    0.0512   \n  6   \trtc_derf           3.606     \t 0.0576   0.0318    0.0465 \n  6      Average           3.537     \t 0.0531   0.0468    0.0493   \n\nPlease review the patch and let us know your opinion.
