      "message": "It looks like all the members of the struct are derived from \u0027mbmi\u0027. So, not sure if it is worth creating this struct.\nFor example, you can just pass \u0027mbmi\u0027 (instead of this struct) to handle_newmv(), and derive the rest as local variables. Right?",

      "message": "Yeah, that\u0027s a good point. Was considering a bunch of variables and lost track of this I guess. My thought was that I can add members in the future but it probably makes more sense to add this when it\u0027s needed.\n\nWhat do you think of all these derived variables by the way? It seems to me that it\u0027s not the greatest to have all these pointers into and copies of data from a struct - kind of obfuscates where the information is from. One thing to note is that mbmi does get changed so maybe the copies are needed, will need to investigate for each variable.",
