      "message": "Looks like the baseline has 2 videos that differ within noise range (\u003c0.02%) and the rest are neutral. There also seem to be drops on a few videos with the enh config enabled and Im not sure if that is a different bug or related to this. I will continue to investigate but I think we can check this in to address the crash now. ",
