      "message": "The default probabilities were changed for EC_MULTISYMBOL in 6933 to fit with the changes to token coding that are under CONFIG_NEW_TOKENSET in this patch. This causes a performance regression with EC_MULTISYMBOL in this patch as you are using the new tables with the old multisymbol encoding. I think it\u0027s sufficient to change line 3751:\n\n+#if CONFIG_NEW_TOKENSET\n-#if CONFIG_EC_MULTISYMBOL",
