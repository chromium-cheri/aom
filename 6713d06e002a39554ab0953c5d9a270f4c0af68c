Should use \"aom_dsp/simd/v64_intrinsics_arm.h\" or else it\u0027ll fail on build systems which don\u0027t have \u0027-I.\u0027\n\nThings like \"./aom_config\" are in the output directory, which needs to be explicitly included anyway.\n\nIt\u0027s not failing now so it\u0027s fine, but third party build systems like firefox and chrome may complain. But we have *lots* of these is vp8 so maybe they\u0027re already prepared.",
