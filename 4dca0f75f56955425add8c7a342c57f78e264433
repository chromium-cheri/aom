      "message": "I have two questions about this change.\n\n1. I am wondering why you refer to the maximum of 2 as the \"theoretical limit\". Could you explain that?\n\nDid you mean a theoretical analysis implies the frame decoding stage cannot possibly use more than two threads per tile?\n\n2. Why does the bug require having more threads than the theoretical limit of 2 to reproduce? It would seem that artificially delaying the thread for the first superblock row should be sufficient.",
