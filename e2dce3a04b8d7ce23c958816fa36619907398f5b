      "message": "I was also wondering about it. The results I report here are after rebasing to the latest baseline and re-running Borg tests, which seems slightly different from what I saw earlier this week. The previous gains at speed 10 are 0.152 and 0.167 on two older baselines. The gain on speed 9 is not degraded though.\n\nI printed the number of frames that have short_signaling enabled, and I didn\u0027t notice significant lower numbers on speed 10 comparing with speed 9. I don\u0027t think it\u0027s caused by less number of frames getting triggered.\n\nThe difference might be related some recent code changes on origin/main, which could be either because the gain on \"--enable_order_hint\u003d0\" was enlarged by some reason, or just from slightly different rate control reaction. Not quite sure.",
