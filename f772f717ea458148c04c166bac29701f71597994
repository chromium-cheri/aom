      "message": "Hello Jingning,\n\nI just confirmed that the patch does not modify the coding stats, while it does when evaluated @ revision 2deaf2a. It looks like the output of get_modeled_qp_offset() is not anymore used (please note that @ revision 2deaf2a, it was still used for Layer1 \u0026 higher ). I will try to identify the commit that overwrites the output of get_modeled_qp_offset(), then check whether changes could coexist.\n\nThanks,\nHassen",

      "message": "Hello Jinging,\n\nWe found that the offsets we proposed could not be tested in context of master as you recently implemented a new QPS model where the fixed offsets are not any more used.\nYou also removed some of the infrastructure we need to evaluate the fixed offsets (as a clean-up since unused circuitry).\nSince the QPS upgrade is the main difference between the revision I used (2deaf2a) and the head, we decided to check the performance of (2deaf2a + the proposed offsets) vs. head in CPU5 for the S2-SDR, and found that head is ~1.5% better than (2deaf2a + the proposed offsets), and ~3.1% better than 2deaf2a.\nTherefore the new QPS model seems to perform better than the old approach that uses the fixed QP offsets, and there is no need to proceed with the commit.\n\nThanks,\nHassen\n",
