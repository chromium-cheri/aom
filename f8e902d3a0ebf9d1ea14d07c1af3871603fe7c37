      "message": "Yannis: The YUV samples here come from the reproducer testcase in b/272139363. Although they are all in the valid range of bit depth 10, note that the value 0 and 1023 are very common.\n\nI inspected the code that generates these samples and I think it is using `fuzztest::InRange` correctly. This means `fuzztest::InRange` does not seem to generate the values using a uniform distribution. It seems to favor the min and max of the range, and seems to like repeating values. Do you know if the behavior of `fuzztest::InRange` is documented?",
