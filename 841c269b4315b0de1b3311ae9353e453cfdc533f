      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\n\nIn this patch, we avoided redundant ref mv population (in case of compound references) for reference frames which are pruned during encoder mode decision. We have not extended the same to single references as \u0027pred_mv_sad\u0027 needs to be populated for all single references and \u0027best_pred_mv_sad\u0027/\u0027min_pred_mv_sad\u0027 is calculated over pruned single references as well. \n\nThe output is bit-exact for all speed levels as per BORG BD-Rate tests. Please review the patch. \n\n            Instruction Count\ncpu-used      Reduction(%)\n   0             0.136\n   1             0.376\n   2             0.408\n   3             0.613\n   4             1.284\n   5             1.109\n   6             1.311\n\nThe instruction count reduction specified has been measured using command:\n\n$ perf stat -e instructions:u ./aomenc ...\n\nThank you\n",
