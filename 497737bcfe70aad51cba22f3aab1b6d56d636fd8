      "message": "Can we make next release libaom 4.0.0, i.e. an incompatible release?\n\nThere\u0027re several reasons:\n\n1. 3.0.0 was released two years ago, I think it\u0027s a long enough time to keep compatibility.\n2. If we want to add new features, it\u0027s difficult to keep compatibility. We can\u0027t keep it forever. At some point we\u0027ll need to break.\n3. Work on AV1 RTC for Meet is very active, especially SVC. It\u0027ll be messy and hard to use if we do this kind of change every time.\n\nJames, Wan-Teh, please let me know what you think.",
