      "message": "Hi Debargha,\n\nThis patch uses limit information(when available) to correct the value of frames_to_key, and also enables TestLevelMonitoringLowBitrate in level_test.cc for single pass.\n\nWe have tested bit-exactness when limit\u003d0 or passes\u003d2. We have also tested some corner cases and internally verified that this change works as intended, for instance, if kf-max-dist\u003d150 and limit\u003d150, this change will have no impact unless there is a scene cut detection(We have verified the validity of this statement in both scenecut and non-scenecut clips).\n\nBD-rate improvement with Borg setup for --cpu-used\u003d1, single pass : +0.1% for midres and lowres clips. \nBD-rate improvement with Borg setup for --cpu-used\u003d5, single pass : +0.1% for HDres, midres and lowres clips.\n\nWe are aware that there is still a failure in TestLevelMonitoringHighBitrate. We believe the failure is because the target-bitrate is set to 4000, and we have verified that the bit-rate being met is 4000 as well. However, level 2.0 (As expected by the test), requires a bit-rate of 1500. It is for this reason that this test is failing for single pass, and hence we have not enabled it currently. We will handle this in future patches.\n\nPlease review.",
