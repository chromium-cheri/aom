      "message": "Hi Yunqing, Cheng,\n\nWe have made the suggested changes from Cheng. We have also corrected the color threshold used for chroma components in av1_rd_pick_palette_intra_sbuv() for hbd path in the patchset-5.\n\nThe speed and quality numbers with patchset-5 are more or less similar to that with patchset-4. The updated results on 10-bit encode for screen content clips (Dota, Minecraft, Screendata, Chinaspeed, Wikipedia) on patchset-5 with tune-content\u003dscreen option are as follows.\n\n CPU  Instruction Count             BD-Rate  Impact %\n        Reduction %        avg.psnr ovr.psnr  ssim       avg.psnr\n                            8-bit    8-bit    8-bit        10-bit  \n  0      -0.573            -0.1142  -0.0389  -0.0307       0.0042            \n  1      -1.729            -0.9317  -1.0346  -1.1905      -0.9241  \n  2       0.014            -0.4035  -0.2317  -0.1503      -0.3383\n  3      -0.364            -0.1535   0.0049  -0.1102      -0.1435\n  4      -0.072             0.4782   0.5197   0.4751       0.4736\n  5      -0.322            -0.2926  -0.2895  -0.0213      -0.2940\n  6      -0.691            -0.2273  -0.2911  -0.2677      -0.2269\n\nIn the commit message, BD rate impact column:\n[+] sign is for BD-Rate drop\n[-] sign is for BD-Rate improvement\nThe instruction count reduction specified has been measured using command:\n$ perf stat -e instructions:u ./aomenc â€¦\n\nThis is a bit-exact change with no speed impact for 8-bit encode (verified locally for a few test cases).\n\nPlease review the patch.\n\nThanks\n",
