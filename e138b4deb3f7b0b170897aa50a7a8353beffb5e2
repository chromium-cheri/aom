      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\nThis patch abstracts tpl_data, tpl_rdmult_scaling_factors and\ntpl_sb_rdmult_scaling_factors to ppi (AV1_PRIMARY). The relevant initializations have also been moved to av1_create_primary_compressor. The variable skip_tpl_setup_stats has been moved out of TplParams and retained in cpi as it changes at a frame level.\n\nThis change is bit-exact and has been locally verified with bitstream match tests over a combination of various configuration values for --threads, --tile-rows, --tile-columns, --cpu-used, --end-usage, --row-mt, etc. \n\nPlease review.",
