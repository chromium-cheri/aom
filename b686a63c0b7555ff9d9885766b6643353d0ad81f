      "message": "Hi Marco, Yunqing,\nIn this CL, we tried improving the error calculation logic in get_filt_error() for 8-bit  encoding. The following CL introduced the logic to calculate the error in the 8-bit domain after CDEF filtering selectively for 8-bit encoding.\nhttps://aomedia-review.googlesource.com/c/aom/+/164322\n\nIn this CL, the logic is further improved to calculate the error always in the 8-bit domain for 8-bit encoding. Thus filtering and error calculation are made faster, by storing filtered output as 8-bit data. This CL produces bit-exact output. We also cleaned-up some control code introduced in the above CL and added asserts in get_cdef_filter_strengths() to silence static analyzer warnings.\n\nPlease check the borg results for real-time encoding mode below. \n```\n               Instruction Count               BD-Rate Loss(%)\ncpu Resolution   Reduction(%)           avg.psnr   ovr.psnr   ssim\n  7        rtc      0.275                0.0000    0.0000    0.0000\n  7  rtc_1080p      0.180                0.0000    0.0000    0.0000\n  7 rtc_screen      0.067                0.0000    0.0000    0.0000\n  8        rtc      0.408                0.0000    0.0000    0.0000\n  8  rtc_1080p      0.310                0.0000    0.0000    0.0000\n  8 rtc_screen      0.058                0.0000    0.0000    0.0000\n  9  rtc_1080p      0.339                0.0000    0.0000    0.0000\n 10  rtc_1080p      0.349                0.0000    0.0000    0.0000\n\n```\n\nThe instruction count reduction specified has been measured using command:\n $ perf stat -e instructions:u ./aomenc â€¦\n\nWe also verified that CL produces bit-exact output for other test-set/speed setting combinations in case of --rt, --good usage.\n\nPlease review the CL. \n\nRegards,\nRanjit",
