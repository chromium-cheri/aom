      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\nThis CL modifies the speed feature intra_y_mode_bsize_mask_nrd for speeds 7 and 8 such that only \u0027INTRA_DC\u0027 mode is used for all block sizes. We noticed that the quality impact is minimal and hence revised the SF setting for speeds 7 and 8. Please note that RT, speed 5, 6 are already using only \u0027INTRA_DC\u0027 mode for all block sizes.\nPlease check the resolution-wise speed and quality results as mentioned below.\n                     Instruction Count     BD-Rate Loss(%)\ncpu-used  Resolution   Reduction(%)     avg.psnr  ovr.psnr   ssim   \n   7         rtc          2.062          0.0604    0.0640   -0.0388\n   7       rtc_derf       2.605          0.1616    0.1541    0.1194\n   7       Average        2.327          0.1026    0.1015    0.0271\n   8         rtc          2.243         -0.0378   -0.0034   -0.1006\n   8       rtc_derf       4.397         -0.0595   -0.0538   -0.1304\n   8       Average        3.294         -0.0378   -0.0034   -0.1006\n   \nIn the commit message :\n[-] sign indicates encode time increase \n[+] sign indicates encode time reduction \nThe instruction count reduction specified has been measured using command:\n$ perf stat -e instructions:u ./aomenc â€¦\nPlease review the patch.\nThank you.",
