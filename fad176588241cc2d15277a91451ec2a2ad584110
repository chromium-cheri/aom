      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\nIn this CL, we have extended the speed feature fast_inter_tx_type_prob_thresh to real time speed\u003d5. We have set the probability threshold to 350 for non-boosted frames and resolutions\u003e\u003d360p. \nAverage bd-rate drop is slightly away from trade-off (trade-off achieved is 0.063).\n\nPlease find the detailed borg result below.\n\n CPU Resolution   Instruction Count          BD-Rate Loss %\n                      Reduction %       avg.psnr ovr.psnr    ssim                                    \n  5    Average           0.912     \t0.0575    0.0177   -0.0301 \n  5    rtc_derf          0.000     \t0.0000    0.0000    0.0000 \n  5      rtc             1.780     \t0.0986    0.0303   -0.0517\n\nIn the commit message, BD rate impact column:\n[+] sign is for BD-Rate drop \n[-] sign is for BD-Rate improvement. \nThe instruction count reduction specified has been measured using command: \n$ perf stat -e instructions:u ./aomenc â€¦ \nFor other speed levels, this is a bit-exact change with no impact on speed (verified locally for few test cases). \n\nPlease review the patch. \n \nThank you.
