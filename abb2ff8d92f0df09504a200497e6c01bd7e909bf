      "message": "Remya,\n\nI have two more suggestions.\n\n1) Ideally we want to skip the application of post-processing filters in all intra mode by default. The idea is that AVIF encoders should benefit from this encoding speedup automatically. Only the tests and programs that need to apply post-processing filters in all intra mode should opt in.\n\nCould you think about how to make this happen? \n\nSince we always want to apply post-processing filters in good-quality and real-time modes, this will require using `skip_inloop_postproc_filtering` only in all intra mode. And if we want a setting that is false by default, we will need to go back to `apply_inloop_postproc_filters` (and perhaps rename it `apply_inloop_postproc_filters_in_all_intra` for clarity).\n\n2) We should have tests that apply or skip the post-processing filters. Right now no tests skip the post-processing filters, so that code path is not tested.\n\nAlso, I think it is a little wordy to say both \"in-loop\" and \"post-processing\". Let\u0027s just pick one of them. I leave this to your discretion. (In the spec, the term \"in loop\" is used once and \"post processing\" or \"post-processing\" is used twice. Not sure which one is more commonly used.)",
