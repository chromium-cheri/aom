      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\n\nWe observed an encoder multi-thread run to run mismatch with row-mt enabled for cpu-used 6. This was caused by the speed feature mv_cost_upd_level \u003d 2, which updated mv costs for a set of SB rows.\n\nThe values in \"x-\u003emv_costs\" were holding uninitialized/previous data in the case of mv_cost_upd_level \u003d 2 as the initialization for the same was happening only for alternate SB rows.\n\nAs a fix, this patch sets the mv cost update to happen once for every SB row, i.e., when row-mt is enabled, the speed feature mv_cost_upd_level is set to 1.\n\nPlease review.\n\nRegards,\nJayasanker.",
