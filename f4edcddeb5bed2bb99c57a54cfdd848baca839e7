      "message": "Hi Wan-Teh,\n\nIn this CL, we have added unit tests to check bit exactness between different thread configurations for allintra encoding mode. The unit-test validates the bit-exactness for AOM_Q mode (the use-case of still picture encoding mode) and considered cq_level\u003d18 for testing purpose. The unit-test ‘AVxEncoderThreadAllIntraTest’ tests for cpu-used 6 whereas the unit-test ‘AVxEncoderThreadAllIntraTestLarge’ tests for cpu-used 0, 2, 4 and 6.\n\nWe thought of combining the unit-tests \u0027AVxEncoderThreadRTTestLarge\u0027 and \u0027AVxEncoderThreadAllIntraTestLarge\u0027 as both are testing for same parameters, but did not pursue for better readability and consistency.\n\nWe also thought of cleaning-up the following code related to decoder control setting (which is present in each unit-test definition), by moving the same to DoTest(). We did not pursue the same as it is not typical practice to add this code in DoTest().\n\n  if (large_scale_tile \u003d\u003d 0) {\n    decoder_-\u003eControl(AV1_SET_TILE_MODE, 0);\n  } else {\n    decoder_-\u003eControl(AV1_SET_TILE_MODE, 1);\n    decoder_-\u003eControl(AV1D_EXT_TILE_DEBUG, 1);\n  }\n\nPlease review the patch. \n\nRegards, \nAniket.",
