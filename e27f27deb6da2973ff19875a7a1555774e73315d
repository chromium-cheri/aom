      "message": "Hi Wan-Teh,\n\nIn this CL, we have introduced CONFIG_AV1_HIGHBITDEPTH macro in is_cur_buf_hbd() and get_buf_by_bd() functions and cleaned-up the code appropriately. This is a follow up CL based on suggestions given in https://aomedia-review.googlesource.com/c/aom/+/135323.\n\nWe have done code clean-up in av1_setup_obmc_dst_bufs() and mode_estimation() functions. We could not do the clean-up in other places as there are calls to highbd specific functions. Hence the relevant code is left untouched under CONFIG_AV1_HIGHBITDEPTH.\n\nFor libaom AV1 video encode, bit match is verified (w.r.t parent commit) for few videos with different video encoding configurations.\n\nPlease review.\n\nThanks \u0026 Regards,\nAniket.\n",
