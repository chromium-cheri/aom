      "message": "It seems strange to pass bsize here, when really you are using this as a flag to indicate if you should do the copy for 8x8 blocks or 4x4 blocks.\n\nInstead of 3 functions, why not just make two functions:\n\ncopy_4x4_blocks_16bit(int16_t *dst, int dstride, int16_t *src, int sstride, dering_list *dering, int dering_count);\n\ncopy_8x8_blocks_16bit(int16_t *dst, int dstride, int16_t *src, int sstride, dering_list *dering, int dering_count);\n\nAnd move the check into the calling function.  This has the same effect but prevents burying a hardcoded value inside an auxiliary function.\n\nif (bsize \u003d\u003d 3)\n\ninside a function that is way easier to read.",
