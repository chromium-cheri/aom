      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\n\nIn this patch, we have modified AVxEncoderThreadTest and AVxEncoderThreadTestLarge to enable testing of temporal filter multi-threading.\n\nIn the earlier test case temporal filter multi-threading was not tested due to the following :\nThe number of frames for which the tests were run was 6, with arnr_maxframes as 7 and g_lag_in_frames as 5. Key frame was not filtered as \"cpi-\u003erc.frames_to_key \u003e cpi-\u003eoxcf.algo_cfg.arnr_max_frames\" was not satisfied. Also, ARF was disabled as \"i \u003c gf_cfg-\u003elag_in_frames\" was not satisfied in define_gf_group().\n\nThe following changes have been made to enable temporal filtering in these tests:\n1. The value of arnr_max_frames is set to 5 to enable KF filtering\n2. The value of max_gf_interval is set to 4 to enable ARF frames for the given limit\n3. The value of g_lag_in_frames is set to 7 to enable filtering for above configuration\n\nThe above values were selected so as to avoid increasing the number of frames for which these tests were performed.\n\nIt was observed that tpl was performed only for KF in parent version. With this change, tpl is performed for ARF also.\n\nPlease review.\n\nRegards,\nJayasanker.",
