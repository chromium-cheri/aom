      "message": "Removing enumerator values is an ABI change, no?\n\nIt\u0027s certainly unlikely that it\u0027s going to cause a problem since the ones being removed were unsupported, and the values removed did not influence the values left in the enum. I believe I might have missed this point in a recent patch that landed.\n\nAnyway, source changes look fine but the commit message could use an edit.",
