      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\nThis patch enables frame parallelism to be supported with multi-tile encoding. It disables FPMT for large-scale tile coding because of potential data race in av1_setup_frame_contexts() and would be enabled after resolution.\n\nThis change is bit-exact and has been locally verified with bitstream match tests over a combination of various configuration values for --threads, --tile-rows, --tile-columns, --cpu-used, --end-usage, --row-mt, etc.\n\nPlease review.",
