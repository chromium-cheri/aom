      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\n\nIn this patch, the function \u0027aom_extend_frame_borders\u0027 is multi-threaded along with CDEF/loop-restoration. Currently, when cdef and loop-restoration are disabled, frame border extension is not multi-threaded along with loop filter (loop-filtering of a superblock row modifies the pixels of the above superblock row and logic to wait for above superblock row to complete needs to be implemented). \n  \nThe multi-thread encode time reduction for rt with row-mt\u003d1 is as follows:\n```\ncpu  Resolution   Tiles  Threads Encode time reduction (%)\n 7    180p          2x1     2        1.7\n 8    180p          2x1     2        1.2\n 9    360p          4x1     4        4.0\n 10   720p          4x1     4        1.5\n 10   1080p screen  4x1     4        1.5\n```\nAlso, we have verified the patch to be bit-exact in good preset with no change in encode time. \n\nPlease review.\n\nThanks",
