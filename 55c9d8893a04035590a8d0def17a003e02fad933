I didn\u0027t realize you were already using std::nothrow in many tests.\n\nThe reason for using std::nothrow (to ensure the test fails in a consistent way when the code is built with exceptions enabled) is not obvious, so I am afraid that new code will be added that uses regular new operators (without std::nothrow).",
