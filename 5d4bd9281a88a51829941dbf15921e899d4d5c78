      "message": "Hi Wan-Teh,\n\nWhen lag-in-frames \u003c\u003d 1, alt-ref buffer is not being used. In this case, temporal filtering for key-frames can be disabled as well. Hence, the memory allocation for alt-ref buffer is avoided.\n\nFor libaom AV1 video encode, bit match is verified (w.r.t parent commit) for few videos for the following cases.\n1) Good Quality (--good): speed presets 1, 3 and 6 with different configurations.\n2) Realtime (--rt): speed presets 1, 4, 7 and 9 with different configurations.\n\nIt was verified that output of AVIF encode is bit-exact with parent version for a typical image dataset.\n\nFollowing are memory reduction results when AVIF encode was tested for ‘building.jpg’ (4032x3024) image at cq_level\u003d18.\n\n   Speed                 HEAP  Memory\n   preset                Reduction(%)\n     6           ~3.5 (from 593.7 MB to 572.9 MB)\n\nAs this change is also applicable to RT path, we have measured the memory reduction for a 1280x720 content.\n   Speed                 HEAP  Memory\n   preset                Reduction(%)\n     7           ~3.4 (from 69.03 MB to 66.66 MB)\n\nHEAP memory reduction was measured using the command below.\n$valgrind --tool\u003dmassif ./avifenc ...\n\nRegards,\nJayasanker.",
