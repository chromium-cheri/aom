      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\nWe have noticed a nightly build failure in CONFIG_REALTIME_ONLY configuration.\nhttps://build.aomedia.org/jenkins/view/libaom-nightly-tests/job/libaom__unit_tests-multi-target/\n\nThis was caused by the cdef refactoring patch which we submitted recently. In that patch we have refactored the function is_8x8_block_skip() with the assumption that sub 8x8 transform sizes are not allowed in CONFIG_REALTIME_ONLY. But we could see RT, speed 5, 6 make use of 4x4 transform sizes. Hence, we are reverting the change in the function.\n\nFor this patch the instruction count change is almost negligible. Please check the results for all RT speed levels.\n     Instruction Count\ncpu    Reduction(%)\n 5       -0.029\n 6       -0.035\n 7       -0.066\n 8       -0.093\n 9       -0.085\n10       -0.093\n\nThe instruction count reduction specified has been measured using command:\n $ perf stat -e instructions:u ./aomenc â€¦\n\nPlease review the patch.\nThank you.",
