      "message": "@bohan - just so you know, I\u0027ve pushed a new patch set. Mainly just cleanup to the SIMD code, should be very slightly faster but it\u0027s pretty close.\n\nAlso added a variance threshold to guard against division by 0. The new check shouldn\u0027t be triggered by the current code, as feature points must be, well, features, and so can\u0027t have zero nearby variance. But it\u0027s good to be prepared for potential future changes.",
