      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\nIn this CL, we have extended the speed feature early_term_after_none_split to --rt, speed \u003d 4.\nThis change is applicable for speed 4 only, as the speed feature is related to recursive partition. \nAverage bd-rate drop is slightly away from trade-off (trade-off achieved is 0.0589).\n\nPlease find the detailed borg result below.\n\n CPU Resolution   Instruction Count      BD-Rate Loss %\n                      Reduction %   avg.psnr  ovr.psnr  ssim                                    \n   4    rtc_derf         6.327      0.3124    0.3036    0.1284 \n   4      rtc            5.865      0.3915    0.3569    0.0869\n   4    Average          6.090      0.3585    0.3347    0.1042\n \nIn the commit message, BD rate impact column:\n[+] sign is for BD-Rate drop \n[-] sign is for BD-Rate improvement. \nThe instruction count reduction specified has been measured using command: \n$ perf stat -e instructions:u ./aomenc â€¦ \nFor other speed levels, this is a bit-exact change with no impact on speed (verified locally for few test cases). \n\nPlease review the patch.\n\nThank you.
