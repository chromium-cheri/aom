I wrote that comment last year but somehow did not publish it, and then I forgot this CL. Recently a similar bug was reported independently. When James and I debugged that bug, it reminded me of this bug and your CL. So I told James about your CL and I published my comment partly for James.\n\nWe will use the new CL that James wrote (https://aomedia-review.googlesource.com/c/aom/+/190181) and properly acknowledge your contribution to the investigation and fix of the bug. After James submits his CL, please rebase this CL and keep just the test part. Thank you!\n\nMy apologies for not finishing the review of your CL last year.",
