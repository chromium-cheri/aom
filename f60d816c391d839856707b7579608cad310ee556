      "message": "CFL_ALLOWED_TYPE was added in https://aomedia-review.googlesource.com/c/aom/+/40761. I think it was just a more readable way to represent the \"is cfl allowed\" boolean. This is recommended, for example, in https://abseil.io/tips/94. Search for \"enum\" in that page.\n\nIn this particular case, `CFL_ALLOWED_TYPE` is the type of the return value rather than a function parameter. Since the return value of `is_cfl_allowed()` is not passed to other functions as an argument, I probably would just have `is_cfl_allowed()` return `bool`.",
