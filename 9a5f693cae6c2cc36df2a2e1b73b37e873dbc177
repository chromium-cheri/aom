      "message": "Hi Jerome and James,\n\nThis is caused by warped motion being disabled in realtime only build, which makes the av1_make_inter_predictor() function a no-op if inter_pred_params-\u003emode \u003d\u003d WARP_PRED. Under that condition, the av1_make_inter_predictor() call in make_masked_inter_predictor() fails to initialize tmp_buf, and the av1_make_inter_predictor() call in the av1_build_one_inter_predictor() call in build_inter_predictors_8x8_and_bigger() fails to initialize tmp_conv_dst.\n\nI described the uninitialized tmp_buf problem in https://crbug.com/1230932#c10. I wrote a fix for the underlying bug at https://aomedia-review.googlesource.com/c/aom/+/143322.",
