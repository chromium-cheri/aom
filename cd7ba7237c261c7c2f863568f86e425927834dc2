      "message": "Agreed about fragility.  This function is substantially different from the \ndecoder_decode function but perhaps could have been put into the same function if \nyou think that\u0027s better.  \n\nI\u0027m not completely sure that it will be less fragile protected by CONFIG_INSPECTION\nin the same function. The code could still move on but I don\u0027t mind trying.\n\nNote this is substantially different from decoder-decode which runs all the hidden \nframes until it actually decodes the full chunk. This function decodes one alt ref \nand returns the pointer into the data of what hasn\u0027t been decoded yet.  It also finds a reference buffer that was updated and returns that pointer so that you can call \nget_reference to get at the reference frame.",
