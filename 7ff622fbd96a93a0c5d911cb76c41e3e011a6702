      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\n\nThis patch abstracts avg_frame_qindex from RATE_CONTROL to PRIMARY_RATE_CONTROL. avg_frame_qindex would be consistent across parallel frames and updated in the post encode process sequentially. Therefore, it is abstracted to the primary rc structure.\n\nThis change implements the simulation in https://aomedia-review.googlesource.com/c/aom/+/138582.\n\nThis change is bit-exact and has been locally verified with bitstream match tests over a combination of various configuration values for --threads, --tile-rows, --tile-columns, --cpu-used, --end-usage,  --row-mt, etc. \n\nPlease review.",
