I am not sure we need this buffer in this function at all anymore.\n\nWhat we could do, is do the od_encode_checkpoint() call in this function, and then pass the od_rollback_buffer to choose_tx_size_fix_type(), so that it does not have to repeatedly checkpoint the same state, but that requires changing the function prototype depending on CONFIG_PVQ, which is a bit ugly (but should be faster).",
