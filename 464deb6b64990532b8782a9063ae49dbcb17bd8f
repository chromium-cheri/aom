      "message": "The verbatim Daala function requires a non-null symbol count. At the moment only bit counts are available, and are not used in the encoder bit stream writing so there is some more work to do which is best done in another commit.\n\nAdding a symbol count and doing something special when it\u0027s small also introduces some overhead that is perhaps best to consider separately.",
