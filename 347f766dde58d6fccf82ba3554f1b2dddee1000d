      "message": "It occurred to me there\u0027s not really any need for a default ctor. And actually, given that these objects are almost certainly going to be heap-allocated, maybe I was a bit hasty in suggesting making it non-copyable.\n\nAccording to go/c-interfaces#do-i-need-to-disable-copy-and-move-operators-in-the-interface-class,\n\n\"If you want to be paranoid, then you can delete operator\u003d() and provide a default constructor. However, the style guide specifically exempts \"interface-only base class[es]\" from these declarations and deletions.\"\n\nSo perhaps we should keep it simple, and just remove all the ctors and the assignment operator. Sorry for the churn.",
