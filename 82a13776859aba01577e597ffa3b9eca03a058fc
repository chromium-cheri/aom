      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\nWe have extended early_term_after_none_split speed feature to speed 3. The speed feature is disabled for low-res as speed quality trade-off is not good for the resolution set. \nWe tested the patch internally and ensured that output is bit exact for other speed levels.\n\nPlease check resolution wise speed and quality results below,\n cpu-used  Resolution   Instruction Count       BD-Rate Loss (%)\n                          Reduction (%)    avg.psnr   ovr.psnr    ssim       \n   3       LOWRES          0.000            0.0000     0.0000    0.0000\n   3       MIDRES          1.716            0.0415     0.0467    0.0198\n   3       HDRES           1.673            0.0481     0.0534    0.0300\n   3       Average         0.844            0.0268     0.0300    0.0034\n   \nIn the commit message, BD-Rate Loss column:\n[+] sign is for BD-Rate loss\n[-] sign is for BD-Rate improvement\n\nThe instruction count reduction specified has been measured using command:\n$ perf stat -e instructions:u ./aomenc â€¦\n\nPlease review the patch.\nThank you.",
