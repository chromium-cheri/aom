      "message": "I see. Thanks. I just revisited the bug in the comment and it was fixed. This CL has been pending because of that bug since last year!\n\nThere are a few places in the tests that could be cleaned up - for example all quantize functions run twice in each test at the moment. And the class of QuantizeTestBase is duplicated in quantize_func_test.cc and quantize_lp_func_test.cc\n\nWhat I can do to clean up is to merge quantize_lp_func_test.cc into quantize_func_test.cc and use the QuantizeTestBase there.\n\nYunqing, since you added test/quantize_lp_func_test.cc, what do you think about this?",
