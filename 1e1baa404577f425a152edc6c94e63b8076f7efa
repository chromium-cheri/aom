      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\nWe have introduced the speed feature ‘skip_tx_no_split_var_based_partition’ for RTC encoding in this CL.\nIn variance based partitioning scheme to check the possibility of merge partition, both NONE \u0026 SPLIT partitions are evaluated. In such cases tx type selection of no split is avoided in the following scenarios,\n1. The partition is decided as split by variance based algorithm.\n2. Tx split is allowed as per available Tx configuration.\n3. The collocated block has zero coded coefficients (eob).\n\nThis patch is applicable for RT, speed 5 and 6 and have no effect on RT, speed \u003c\u003d 4 and speed \u003e\u003d 7.\n\nPlease find the Borg results below.\n                     Instruction Count     BD-Rate Loss(%)\ncpu-used  Resolution   Reduction(%)     avg.psnr  ovr.psnr   ssim   \n   5         rtc          0.843         -0.1384   -0.1579   -0.2134\n   5       rtc_derf       1.105         -0.1830   -0.2162   -0.2246\n   5       Average        0.981         -0.1570   -0.1822   -0.2365\n   6         rtc          0.303         -0.0702   -0.0827    0.0027\n   6       rtc_derf       0.371         -0.0513   -0.0201    0.0031\n   6       Average        0.337         -0.0603   -0.0510    0.0030\n   \nIn the commit message, BD rate impact column: \n[+] sign is for BD-Rate drop \n[-] sign is for BD-Rate improvement. \nThe instruction count reduction specified has been measured using command:\n$ perf stat -e instructions:u ./aomenc … \nFor other speed levels, this is a bit-exact change with no impact on speed (verified locally for few test cases).\n\n\n",
