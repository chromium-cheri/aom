      "message": "Hi Wan-Teh, Cheng, Chi-Yo,\n\nThis CL unifies the handling of the sf prune_palette_search_level for the values 0 and 2. The separate handling for sf \u003d 0 was introduced when sf \u003d 2 path performed the palette_size search in descending order followed by ascending order. Now that the order of evaluation is changed in sf \u003d 2 path, the sf \u003d 0 path could also be handled under a common else part together with sf \u003d 2 handling.\n\nThis patch is verified to be bit-exact for speed 0 and speed \u003e\u003d 3 with AVIF encode for a typical image dataset.\n\nPlease review.\n\nRegards,\nJayasanker.",
