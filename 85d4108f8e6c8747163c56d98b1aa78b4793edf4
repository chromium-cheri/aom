      "message": "I have been running some test with different thresholds and also looking at how the behavior of the patch changes at different Q and for different speed settings. I certainly think that it is worth backing off a bit on the threshold for high speed settings and we may also wish to consider only using it within a range of Q values. It is already only enabled by the all-intra flag but we could optionally put it behind some other perceptual quality flag as it will have some negative impact on traditional metrics.\n\nI will check in a slight revision later in regard to encode speed but we can always tweak this further at a later date.",
