      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\n\nIn this CL, changed the check of x/y offset from 8 to 4 in aom_sub_pixel_avg_variance32xh_avx2(). As offset of 4 corresponds to half pel point, the check should be with 4 instead of 8 (as offset varies from 0 to 7). \n\nAs mentioned in issue tracker, the incorrect check was leading to sub-optimal speed (but was functionally correct) and this patch addresses the issues with speed in this module.\n\nThe gains are very minimal and the following are instruction count reduction results for a typical borg setup. Bit match is verified for speed presets 2 to 6.\n\n cpu-preset  Instruction Count\n                 Reduction %\n     3            0.092\n     4            0.104\n\nThe instruction count reduction specified has been measured using command:\n$ perf stat -e instructions:u ./aomenc ...\n\nPlease review the patch.\n\nThanks \u0026 Regards,\nVenkata.",
