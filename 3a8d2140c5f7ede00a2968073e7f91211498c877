      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\n\nWe have rebased this patch to the latest version. Following are the results for speed 5.\n\n\n cpu-used   Resolution   Instruction Count \t   BD-Rate Loss (%)\n\t\t\t  Reduction (%)     avg.psnr   ovr.psnr   ssim \t\t\t\t\t\n  5\t     LOWRES\t     8.84            0.4040    0.3678    0.2855\n  5\t     MIDRES\t     8.274           0.0878    0.0328   -0.0932\n  5\t     HDRES\t     7.512          -0.1336   -0.0925    0.0401\n  5\t     Average\t     8.364           0.1476    0.1294    0.0998\n  \n  5\t     ugc360p\t     9.12            0.4397    0.1887    0.0318\n  \n\nFrom the above results, we see that the trade-off ratio (BD-Rate to instruction count reduction ratio) for ugc360p is 1/20.7 (well within the expected ratio of 1/10) with good speed-up. Please review the patch. \n\nWe shall work on extending this speed feature to speed 4 after this patch is merged.\n\nThanks",
