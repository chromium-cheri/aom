      "message": "Would it make more sense for this to be the outer loop? Then you could do the horizontal and vertical filter in the same iteration, and would only need an 8-pixel wide temporary buffer. The total cache footprint should be smaller, but I don\u0027t know if the access pattern would confuse the hardware prefetch for the source (this may be a lost cause for large blocks either way).\n\nYou could even use a circular buffer in the vertical direction, and reduce the temporary buffer to round_up_to_power_of_2(max_taps)x8, but that may be overkill (you have to merge the two loops over i with a lag for the vertical filter).",
