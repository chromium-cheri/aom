'''Run this python script to generate values for the uv_txsize_lookup array.

This array stores four transform sizes for each block size and starting
transform size. These transform sizes are the transform size to use when
partitioning the block: not at all, horizontally, vertically, both ways.

For example, if the block size is BLOCK_8X8 and the transform size is TX_8X4,
the list of sizes is { TX_8X4, TX_8X4 }, { TX_4X4, TX_4X4 }. This is because
the partitioned block sizes are BLOCK_8X8, BLOCK_4X8, BLOCK_4X8, BLOCK_4X4 and
each transform listed is the largest transform that fits in both TX_8X4 and its
corresponding partitioned block size.

The output has #if / #endif pairs to deal with configuration options. The
simplest question is whether a given block size exists (BLOCK_2X2 through
BLOCK_4X2 require CONFIG_CHROMA_2X2 or CONFIG_CHROMA_SUB8X8; BLOCK_64X128
through BLOCK_128X128 require CONFIG_EXT_PARTITION). More complicated, the
correct answer for an entry might depend on the set of config options. For
example, see BLOCK_4X4: if CONFIG_CHROMA_2X2 is set, the blocks will divide
down to 2X2, 2X4 or 4X2, giving TX_2X2 in the output. If not, the transform
sizes will never get smaller than 4X4.

At the moment, there is a constraint that a transform never gets less square
than it started (so a square never gets chopped into a 2:1 rectangle, for
example). There is also a constraint about when 2X2 transforms get generated,
which tries to match the previous handwritten table. These constraints are
guaranteed by the code in greatest_txforms_within, which can easily be changed
if we decide to allow such divisions.
