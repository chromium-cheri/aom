The Lanczos resampling library and utilities are developed by Google
initially and contributed to the Alliance for open Media for experiments
related to super-resolution and Adaptive Streaming use cases.

For questions and technical support, please contact debargha@google.com

The main library source and header files are:
lanczos_resample.c
lanczos_resample.h

In addition, two utilities are provided to resample y4m and yuv videos
respectively:
lanczos_resample_y4m (built using source lanczos_resample_y4m.c)
lanczos_resample_y4m (built using source lanczos_resample_yuv.c)

The usage of lanczos_resample_y4m is:
  lanczos_resample_y4m
      <y4m_input>
      <num_frames>
      <horz_p>:<horz_q>:<Lanczos_horz_a>[:<horz_x0>]
      <vert_p>:<vert_q>:<Lanczos_vert_a>[:<vert_x0>]
      <y4m_output>
      [<outwidth>x<outheight>]
  Notes:
      <num_frames> is number of frames to be processed
      <horz_p>/<horz_q> gives the horz resampling ratio.
      <vert_p>/<vert_q> gives the vert resampling ratio.
      <Lanczos_horz_a>, <Lanczos_vert_a> are Lanczos parameters.
      <horz_x0>, <vert_x0> are optional initial offsets
                                        [default centered].
          If used, they can be a number in (-1, 1),
                   or a number in (-1, 1) prefixed by 'i' meaning
                       using the inverse of the number provided,
                   or 'c' meaning centered
      <outwidth>x<outheight> is output video dimensions
                             only needed in case of upsampling

Example usages:

1a. Downsample 10 frames from Boat_1920x1080_60fps_10bit_420.y4m by
    ratio 3/2 horizontally and 4/3 vertically with Lanczos parameter
    6 for both and centered sampling.

    lanczos_resample_y4m Boat_1920x1080_60fps_10bit_420.y4m 20 \
                         2:3:6 3:4:6 /tmp/down.y4m

1b. Reverse the process in 1a. That is, upsample 10 frames from
    /tmp/boat.y4m by ratio 3/2 horizontally and 4/3 vertically with
    Lanczos parameter 6 for both and centered sampling. The output
    dimension desired is specified to be 1920x1080.

    lanczos_resample_y4m /tmp/down.y4m 10 3:2:6 4:3:6 /tmp/downup.y4m 1920x1080

2a. Similar to 1a, except using left-aligned sampling

    lanczos_resample_y4m Boat_1920x1080_60fps_10bit_420.y4m 20 \
                         2:3:6:0 3:4:6:0 /tmp/down.y4m

2b. Reversing the process in 2a.

    lanczos_resample_y4m /tmp/down.y4m 10 3:2:6:0 4:3:6:0 /tmp/downup.y4m \
                         1920x1080

3a. Similar to 1a, except using a specified initial offset of 0.125 horizontally
    and center aligned sampling vertically

    lanczos_resample_y4m Boat_1920x1080_60fps_10bit_420.y4m 20 \
                         2:3:6:0.125 3:4:6 /tmp/down.y4m

3b. Reversing the process in 3a.

    lanczos_resample_y4m /tmp/down.y4m 10 3:2:6:i0.125 4:3:6 /tmp/downup.y4m \
                         1920x1080

The usage of lanczos_resample_yuv is similar but with two extra
arguments to specify the input format:
  lanczos_resample_yuv
      <yuv_input>
      <width>x<height>
      <pix_format>
      <num_frames>
      <horz_p>:<horz_q>:<Lanczos_horz_a>[:horz_x0]
      <vert_p>:<vert_q>:<Lanczos_vert_a>[:vert_x0]
      <yuv_output>
      [<outwidth>x<outheight>]
  Notes:
      <width>x<height> is input video dimensions.
      <pix_format> is one of { yuv420p, yuv420p10, yuv420p12,
                               yuv422p, yuv422p10, yuv422p12,
                               yuv444p, yuv444p10, yuv444p12 }
      <num_frames> is number of frames to be processed
      <horz_p>/<horz_q> gives the horz resampling ratio.
      <vert_p>/<vert_q> gives the vert resampling ratio.
      <Lanczos_horz_a>, <Lanczos_vert_a> are Lanczos parameters.
      <horz_x0>, <vert_x0> are optional initial offsets
                                        [default centered].
          If used, they can be a number in (-1, 1),
                   or a number in (-1, 1) prefixed by 'i' meaning
                       using the inverse of the number provided,
                   or 'c' meaning centered
      <outwidth>x<outheight> is output video dimensions
                             only needed in case of upsampling



In addition to these utilities, a script lanczos_downup.sh is provided
downsample a video with specified parameters and then reversing the
process using two lanczos_resample_y4m commands. The usage for the script is:

  lanczos_downup.sh
      <y4m_input>
      <num_frames>
      <horz_resampling_config>
      <vert_resampling_config>
      <downup_y4m>
      [<down_y4m>]

  Notes:
      <y4m_input> is input y4m video
      <num_frames> is number of frames to process
      <horz_resampling_config> is in the format:
              <horz_p>:<horz_q>:<Lanczos_horz_a>[:horz_x0]
          similar to what is used by lanczos_resample_y4m utility.
      <vert_resampling_config> is in the format:
              <vert_p>:<vert_q>:<Lanczos_vert_a>[:vert_x0]
          similar to what is used by lanczos_resample_y4m utility.
      <downup_y4m> is the output y4m video.
      <down_y4m> is optional. If skipped the intermediate resolution
          file is deleted.
