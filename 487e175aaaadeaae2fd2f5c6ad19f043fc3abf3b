I sadly had to resubmit the complete patch because I couldn\u0027t seem to rebase it, and had to apply it manually.\n\nI didn\u0027t manage to find a way to forcefully rebase it via Git, so I had to abandon it completely and rebase it that way. I hope I\u0027ll be able to find a different way of doing it next time.\n\nI hope I\u0027ll be able to find a different way of doing it next time :)",
