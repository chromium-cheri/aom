The results are as follows:\n\n cpu-used   Resolution  Instruction Count       BD-Rate Loss (%)\n                          Reduction (%)    avg.psnr   ovr.psnr    ssim       \n    6       LOWRES          2.46            0.2868     0.2991    0.2013 \n    6       MIDRES          0.88            0.1258     0.1439    0.0414\n    6       HDRES           1.42            0.2357     0.2432    0.1892\n    6       Average         1.81            0.2241     0.2366    0.1508 \n    \nIn the commit message, BD-Rate Loss column:\n[+] sign is for BD-Rate loss\n[-] sign is for BD-Rate improvement\nThe instruction count reduction specified has been measured using command:\n$ perf stat -e instructions:u ./aomenc â€¦  \n\nPlease review the patch.\n\nThanks",
