      "message": "Hi Wan-Teh,\n\nThis function is applicable under the conditions in assert. However, we also feel that assert should be removed and the same should be added under condition check.\n\nWe are pushing a patch with intrinsic implementation of 2x2 convolution, which also has similar asserts inside the function.\nhttps://aomedia-review.googlesource.com/c/aom/+/125463\n\nOnce above patch gets merged, we shall submit another patch to remove asserts and add the conditions accordingly.\n\nPlease let us know your opinion on the same.\n\nThanks \u0026 Regards,\nAniket",
