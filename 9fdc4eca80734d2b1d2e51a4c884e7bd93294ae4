      "message": "the adjustments above alone are not going to do the trick. The dual mode is implemented without EC_SMALLMUL. The cdfs that are passed here are ICDF, meaning that they are monotonically decreasing, however the dual mode is implemented with 0 interval first and 1 interval second. In other words in EC_SMALLMUL icdf[0] is a prob of 1, however in dual mode the prob0 is the probability of 0. The adaptation is also as in cdf mode.\n\nLet me know if this is a problem and you would rather stick to EC_ADAPT\u0027s reverse order.",
