      "message": "Hi Wan-Teh/Frank,\n\nThis patch introduces the speed feature early_term_luma_palette_size_search in allintra speed 0 path with a less aggressive header rdcost based breakout condition. The existing logic under sf\u003d1 path is moved under sf\u003d2 path.\n\nFollowing are instruction count reduction results w.r.t the parent version when AVIF encode was tested for a typical image dataset.\n\nwith --tune\u003dpsnr,\n\n          Instruction Count    BD-Rate Loss(%)\ncpu-used     Reduction(%)      psnr       ssim\n   0            1.937          0.0000     0.0002\n\nwith --tune\u003dssim,\n\n          Instruction Count    BD-Rate Loss(%)\ncpu-used     Reduction(%)      psnr       ssim\n   0           2.030          -0.0001     0.0006\n\nFollowing are instruction count reduction results w.r.t the parent version when allintra video encode was tested for the screen content test set.\n\n          Instruction Count        BD-Rate Loss(%)\ncpu-used     Reduction(%)   avg.psnr  ovr.psnr    ssim\n   0           2.490         0.0104    0.0095     0.0084\n\nThis change is verified to be bit-exact for speeds \u003e 0 in allintra encoding mode.\n \nIn the commit message, BD rate impact column:\n[+] sign is for BD-Rate drop\n[-] sign is for BD-Rate improvement\nThe instruction count reduction specified has been measured using command:\n$ perf stat -e instructions:u ./avifenc â€¦\n\nPlease review.\n\nRegards,\nJayasanker.\n\n",
