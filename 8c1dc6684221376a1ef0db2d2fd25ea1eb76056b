      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\n\nCurrently \u0027cm-\u003ecur_frame\u0027 is released in assign_cur_frame_new_fb() at the start of the encode of next frame. Hence, during FPMT, the release of \u0027cm-\u003ecur_frame\u0027 assigned to a parallel cpi will happen only when that cpi is next used. This patch releases a previously used frame buffer before swapping cpi in\nav1_get_parallel_frame_enc_data() thereby ensuring its timely release.\n\nThis change is bit-exact and has been locally verified with bitstream match tests over a combination of various configuration values for --threads, --tile-rows, --tile-columns, --cpu-used, --end-usage, --row-mt, etc. \n\nPlease review.\n\nRegards,\nRemya",
