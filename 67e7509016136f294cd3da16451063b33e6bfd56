      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\n\nThe function aom_mse_wxh_16bit_sse2() is used in the CDEF module to calculate the MSE. The existing implementation is done at 32/64 bit level. But for the given input range, the precision at which computations happen can be reduced (verified with the maximum value possible for src buffer i.e., CDEF_VERY_LARGE). This CL, improves the SSE2 implementation with reduced precision. With these improvements, module level scaling is improved by 40% w.r.t. previous SSE2.\n\nPlease note that, these improvements for AVX2 were already taken care in https://aomedia-review.googlesource.com/c/aom/+/162822\n\nPlease review this CL.\n\nThanks \u0026 Regards,\nDiksha",
