      "message": "This line seems to imply the aom_codec_cx_pkt_t struct should be 128 bytes. There are two problems.\n\n1. Old problem: The size of the \u0027pad\u0027 array does not take into account the gap between the \u0027kind\u0027 and \u0027data\u0027 members. The gap is required to align \u0027data\u0027 on a pointer-size boundary (see line 114, which is a pointer). I don\u0027t know how to fix this.\n\n2. New problem: I think the \u0027psnr\u0027 union member is more than 128 bytes now.",
