      "message": "Debargha, Urvang, Regarding the precision of SSE and mean. For an 16bit input SSE seems to overflow the 32-bit int. It is probably good to increase the data type of SSE to int64.  Also, type casting mean before multiplication operator seems ok for now, may be adding a assert to make sure var \u003e 0 may be useful in future. ",
