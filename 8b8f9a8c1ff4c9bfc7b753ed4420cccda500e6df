      "message": "No it is safe to include this guard here.  All this does is expose the new daala_idctX() and daala_fdstX() functions so that they can be called in place of aom_idctX_c() and aom_iadstX_c() functions, which unlike av1/encoder/dct.c, are defined outside of this file.\n\nI could have done this for just one size at a time, but the rest of the patches in this stack will use all of the sizes.",
