      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\n\nIn this patch, we have abstracted row-level code from tf_do_filtering() in order\nto facilitate multithreading. Also, buffers which are used in temporal filtering\nwhich would be thread-specific are moved into the ThreadData structure.\n\nThis is a bit-exact change with no speed impact (verified locally).\n\nPlease review.\n\nRegards,\nJayasanker.",
