      "message": "Thanks Jonathan. Just to note: we put this ~2-4% based on the RTC video results you last sent, for the Jan-June range, which is pretty close to the 3.6-3.7 range. Feel free to change/update it.\n\nFor screen: for speeds 6-8 there were speedups from algorithm changes, so hard to separate out the gains from your work. But for speed 9 and 10 we measured neutral and ~2 slowdown from our algorithm changes (to reduce artifacts), so we can add the speedups from your work (added above).",
