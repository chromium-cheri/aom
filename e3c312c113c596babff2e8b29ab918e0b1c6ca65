I\u0027m not arguing against it, but perhaps my understanding of how the buffering works is too shallow to understand what\u0027s being done here.  What would happen if this code is absent?  I was working on a similar solution in parallel, and my patch would look similar to your patch absent this part.",

It makes sense to rebase your patch on top of mine - that way each patch addresses one problem, rather than conflating both fixes into one patch. Hope you don\u0027t mind!",
