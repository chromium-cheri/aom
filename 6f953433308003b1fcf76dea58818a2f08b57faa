      "message": "Nit/optional: This function is very long, so I am tempted to suggest we declare the variable \u0027bd_info\u0027 near its first use, such as here. On the other hand, one could argue that it is clearer to prepare \u0027bd_info\u0027 at the beginning of the function. I leave this decision to you.",
