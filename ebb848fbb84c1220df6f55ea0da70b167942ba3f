      "message": "Nice memory reduction for both encoder \u0026 decoder!\n\nQuestions: The results shown above are for multi-tile \u0026 multi-thread cases. This should also help single-tile/single thread situation, right? Also, above encoder test used cpu-used \u003d 5. Global motion (GM) is disabled at speed 5, right? Do we still allocate GM related memory at speed 5? Should you test speed 1 or 2 where GM is enabled?",
