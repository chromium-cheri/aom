      "message": "This documentation could use some kind of hint as to what constitutes a valid operating point. Is there any way for a user of this API to even know how many operating points a stream defines? Looking at scalable_decoder.c and reading the code you added to obu.c, I guess the thing to do is to use aom_codec_peek_stream_info() and then look at aom_codec_stream_info_t::enhancement_layers_cnt, but I don\u0027t know how someone is expected to figure that out without reading the implementation.",
