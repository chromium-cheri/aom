      "message": "Jingning: When I debugged this bug, I noticed that the struct members of `gf_group` are not documented. Could you add some comments to the `gf_group` struct, especially for the `layer_depth` and `max_layer_depth` members?\n\nFrom the members\u0027 names, I would guess `max_layer_depth` is the maximum of all the `layer_depth[i]` array elements, and expect that they satisfy the property `layer_depth[i] \u003c\u003d max_layer_depth`. But the code here shows that\u0027s not the case. So the comments will be very helpful. Thanks.",
