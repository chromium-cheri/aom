      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\n\nThis patch abstracts previous frame q related members from RATE_CONTROL to PRIMARY_RATE_CONTROL. After the integration, these members will be consistent across parallel frames and updated in the post encode process sequentially.\n\nThis change implements the simulation in https://aomedia-review.googlesource.com/c/aom/+/140062\n\nThis change is bit-exact and has been locally verified with bitstream match tests with CONFIG_FRAME_PARALLEL_ENCODE enabled, num_fp_contexts\u003d2. This change is also verified for CONFIG_FRAME_PARALLEL_ENCODE disabled.\n\nPlease review the patch.\nThanks",
