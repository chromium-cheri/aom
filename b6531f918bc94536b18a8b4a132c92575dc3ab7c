      "message": "Yes, this was an oversight.  I added clpf_strength \u003d\u003d 0 to the test (so there now is a way to signal threshold \u003d\u003d 0 and clpf_strength \u003d\u003d 3), and I will check AWCY, though this is a very special case and I don\u0027t really expect any changes beyond the noise level no matter how this is dealt with.  But anything other than two different ways to signal threshold \u003d\u003d 0 \u0026\u0026 clpf_strength \u003d\u003d 0 ought to be slightly better regardless of what AWCY will say.",
