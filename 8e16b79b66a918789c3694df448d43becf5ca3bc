      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\n\nDual loop filter optimization was enabled for clips with multiple of 8 width and height in non-rd rt mode. In this patch, we have enabled the dual loop filter optimization for all resolutions. The results are as follows:\n\n     Instruction Count\ncpu    Reduction(%)\n 7       0.762\n 8       1.262\n 9       1.557\n 10      1.675\n\nSpecifically, the results for rtc-dert test set (which includes clips of resolution 320x180, 180x320) are as follows \n\n     Instruction Count\ncpu    Reduction(%)\n 7       1.576\n 8       2.607\n 9       3.218\n 10      3.465\n\n The instruction count reduction specified has been measured using command\n $ perf stat -e instructions:u ./aomenc â€¦\n\n\nPlease review. \n\nThank you.",
