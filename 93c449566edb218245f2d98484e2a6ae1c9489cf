      "message": "I assume the current setup is to use the q value to decide 1/8 precision on and off? If that\u0027s the case, this function call seems not quite right, since it will only be called once per frame at the initial q value for frame encoding.\n\nHowever, later on the encoder might run through multiple q values in the recode loop to find the one that meets the frame size budget best. The motion precision however has been set once and only based on the first q value, even if the selected frame q might be a lot smaller than it.\n\nIt seems that line 5126 on the left side is a right place to do so.",
