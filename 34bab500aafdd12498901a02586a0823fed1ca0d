      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\n\nThis patch fixes the computation of num_mod_workers[] for parallel frames when the worker distribution across threads is uneven. \n\nThis is applicable when the total no. of workers available is not a multiple of the number of parallel frames. For example, when we have 15 workers and 2 parallel frames, the workers are to be distributed as 8 for the first frame and 7 for the second (in the parent version, it was distributed as 8 each).\n\nPlease review.\n\nThanks,\nNithya",
