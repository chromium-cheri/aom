      "message": "Hi George,\n\nThank you very much for your comment! I really appreciate it.\n\nI was just getting a little tired of dealing with libyuv build issues in the past few days, so I did not try very hard in this CL. You can see that I did not update the source file list at line 116. And the SVE files need a different compiler option, so I need to put them in a new cmake object library. Also note that I am compiling all the libyuv sources files with `-march\u003darmv8-a+dotprod+i8mm`, not just the _neon.cc and _neon64.cc files.\n\nI will look into it.",

      "message": "I can sympathise with the pain of working on anything related to build systems!\n\nPerhaps eventually we could swap to using libyuv\u0027s own CMakeLists.txt as a subproject rather than duplicating the build commands here? I have been using the libyuv cmake locally and it seems to work well for Arm at least. I appreciate that \"rip out everything you already have and replace it with something else\" is probably not a particularly helpful suggestion to get something working in the short term however.",
