      "message": "In this CL, a `longjmp` target has been introduced in `tf_worker_hook()` to facilitate the error propagation in case of temporal filter multithreading. \n\nA flag `tf_mt_exit` is introduced in the structure `AV1TemporalFilterSync` which will be set to 1 in case a main/worker thread encounters an error. The other workers will terminate their jobs appropriately by checking the status of this flag. Added `tf_dealloc_data()` calls inside `aom_codec_destroy()` to de-allocate the temporal filter buffers in case of an error during temporal filtering. \n\nThis change is bit-exact and has been verified using bitstream-match tests for a combination of various configuration values for --threads, --tile-rows, --tile-columns, --cpu-used, --end-usage, --row-mt, --fp-mt, etc. Validated all unit-tests with sanitizers (address and thread) and valgrind.\n\nThis CL also adds a comment in `enc_row_mt_worker_hook()` as per the suggestion in [CL](https://aomedia-review.googlesource.com/c/aom/+/177341).",
