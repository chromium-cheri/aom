      "message": "This codec control was released in libavif v3.8.0. So we can\u0027t change its meaning in a v3.x.y release.\n\nWe will need to add a new codec control, say `AV1E_SET_MAX_CONSEC_DROP_TIME_CBR`.\n\nI took a quick look. It should be possible to support both. So this is not a serious problem. We can mark `AV1E_SET_MAX_CONSEC_FRAME_DROP_CBR` as deprecated and recommend the new codec control instead, if that\u0027s your intention.\n\nWe should also document that if both codec controls are specified, which one has effect.",
