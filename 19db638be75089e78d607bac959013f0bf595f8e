      "message": "Hi Wan-Teh,\n\nIn this patch, we have removed the memset which is not required in filter_intra_predictor module. \nmemset has been removed from the following functions.\n    •    av1_filter_intra_predictor_neon()\n    •    av1_filter_intra_predictor_sse4_1()\n    •    av1_filter_intra_predictor_c()\n    •    highbd_filter_intra_predictor()\n\nFor libaom AV1 encode, bit match is verified (w.r.t parent commit) for few videos for the following cases (64 bit + 32 bit build)\n1) C and SSE4_1 path of low bit depth for speed presets 3 and 6.\n2) C path of high bit depth for speed presets 3 and 6.\n3) C and NEON path of arm for speed preset 6.\n\nIt was verified that output of AVIF encode is bit-exact with parent version for a typical image dataset. There was a marginal AVIF encode time reduction of 0.5% seen for speed\u003d6 at cq-level\u003d18.\n\nAnd also we pushed patchset 2, by forcing C path without memset and observed that no issues were reported by gerrit.\n\nPlease review.\n\nThanks \u0026 Regards,\nAniket.",
