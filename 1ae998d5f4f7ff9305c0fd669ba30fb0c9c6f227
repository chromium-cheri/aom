      "message": "Hi Yunqing, \nIn this CL, we have allocated TPL buffers (stats buffers and frame buffers) based on lag_in_frames. \nThis CL is verified to be bit-exact with no impact on encode-time. We have tested this for various values of lag_in_frames. Memory is measured using the command valgrind --tool\u003dmassif ./aomenc ...\n\nThe memory reduction results for speed 6 are as follows\n                        Memory Reduction(%)\n                        Single      Multi\nResolution    Tile      thread      thread\n640x360       2x1       8.54        8.03(2 threads)\n832x480       2x1       9.68        9.26(2 threads)\n1280x720      2x2       10.78       10.07(4 threads)\n1920x1080     4x2       11.59       10.71(8 threads)\n\nThe memory savings are similar for other speed levels as well .\n",
