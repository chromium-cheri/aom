      "message": "Can you elaborate on how that would work? The way I see it, before the change:\n\n* output_bit_depth gets the value from the flag --output-bit-depth\n* if it is not set, then it gets it from the codec bit depth\n\n\nAfter the change:\n* output_bit_depth does not get the value from the flag; instead fixed_output_bit_depth does\n* Same checks as before, but with fixed_output_bit_depth instead\n\nI don\u0027t see the difference in behavior. If you could provide clarification, it would be appreciation.",
