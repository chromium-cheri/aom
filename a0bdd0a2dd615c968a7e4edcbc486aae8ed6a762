      "message": "In this CL, the allocation failure of the local buffer in `av1_selfguided_restoration_avx2()` and `av1_selfguided_restoration_sse4_1()` is correctly serviced by passing thread-specific `error_info` to the low level functions. The buffer allocations are not done outside the SIMD functions as the size varies depending on the architecture (avx2 vs sse4_1).\n\nThe return type of `av1_apply_selfguided_restoration()` is changed to return -1 on allocation failure (avx2 and sse4_1) and 0 otherwise and did the appropriate change in av1_rtcd_defs.pl and selfguided_filter_test.cc.\n\nThis change is bit-exact and has been verified using bitstream-match tests for a combination of various configuration values for --threads, --tile-rows, --tile-columns, --cpu-used, --end-usage, --row-mt, --fp-mt, etc. Validated all unit-tests with sanitizers (address and thread) and valgrind.",
