      "message": "I\u0027n fine with it. The reason we had this there (in fill_variance_4x4avg) was to give option on inter-frames to compute variance based on 4x4 avg (8x8 avg can be too coarse) to get better signal for split decision. Also if we ever want to allow 4x4 blocks then 4x4 avg is needed. But not much testing has been on that, and if needed can add it back.",
