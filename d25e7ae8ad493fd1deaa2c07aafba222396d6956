I found that they are not equivalent when the value is very close to INT16_MAX because _mm_add_epi16(v_val_d, v_bias_d) will overflow.\n\nChanging _mm_add_epi16 to the saturated add _mm_add_epi16 gives an answer that\u0027s still not equal to ROUND_POWER_OF_TWO(v_val_d, bits) but only off by one.",
