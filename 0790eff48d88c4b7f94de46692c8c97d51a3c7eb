      "message": "This avoids us accessing illegal memory locations.  \n\nHowever, in order for the film grain to have no effect when num_points is equal to 0, I think we also need to memset scaling_lut to 0 here.  (Strictly speaking, the film grain process still have a slight effect because the clipping to studio range can still be applied even when num_points is 0.)",

      "message": "Setting to zero is done in the init_arrays() function, see first three lines. \n\nRegarding skipping completely processing of the component if num_points is zero, I am planning to do that as the part of supporting monochrome (this is planned as a separate patch).",
