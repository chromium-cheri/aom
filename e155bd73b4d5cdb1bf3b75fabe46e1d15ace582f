      "message": "Hi Jayasanker: I am backporting a commit of yours to the applejack branch (used for libaom 2.0.x releases). I\u0027d appreciate it if you could take a look at this CL.\n\nNote that the applejack branch does not have yjshen\u0027s first fix for this bug (commit fbf298a0fd553a9cbb8ffd5790ec4c1c8de1c201). Therefore we just need to modify the assertion.\n\nThank you!",

      "message": "Hi Wan-Teh,\n\nThe assertion could be simplified further as you have mentioned in the commit message. But as per the design, the SIMD module expects block_height to be greater than or equal to 4. In case assertion is modified, we feel that the assertion should contain above check for block_height as well.\n\nRegards,\nJayasanker.",
