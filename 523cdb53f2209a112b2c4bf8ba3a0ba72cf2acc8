      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\nWe have identified few variables in pack bitstream functions which can potentially create race condition in multithreading. Hence, in this CL we have moved such variables to a thread specific memory. Please check the details below,\n* In order to make the computations of interp_filter_selected, max_mv_magnitude and coefficient_size variables thread safe, the variables are accessed from ThreadData instead of AV1_COMP. After bitstream preparation the variables are collated to AV1_COMP structure.\n* In order to make cm-\u003eerror structure thread safe, the structure is modified to access from MACROBLOCK.\nThis patch is tested locally for bit match. Please review.\nThank you.\n",
