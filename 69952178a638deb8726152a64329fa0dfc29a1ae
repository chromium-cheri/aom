      "message": "It would also be nice to refactor this code out into its own module so that it can be tested: my understanding is that this code is being added to support use of libaom in other tools. Testing such code is typically a good practice-- downstream project users and maintainers are usually displeased when untested interface code breaks things.\n\nIn other words: FFmpeg users and developers would likely prefer that the libaom wrapper not break FFmpeg due to arg processing errors that could be caught on the aom side by adding some tests.",
