      "message": "Hi Frank/Chi-Yo,\n\nAs per our understanding, Jenkins does validation tests to check bit-match for specific contents (e.g., bus, city) for speed \u003d1 as per the link below. \nhttps://build.aomedia.org/jenkins/job/libaom__encode_multijob/21168/\n\nThis helps in catching bit-match issues for speed 1 in case of refactoring patches. The issue seen in refactoring patch (related to partitioning) would have been caught in case of similar test for 1080p, speed\u003d6.\n\nOverall, it might be required to add bit-match tests for different resolutions, usages and speed presets to catch issues in case of refactoring (when STATS_CHANGED is not mentioned in commit message). \n\nThanks \u0026 Regards,\nVenkata.",
