      "message": "Hi Wan-Teh,\n\nThis CL adds unit test coverage for the sharpness parameter by testing the adherence to a given PSNR threshold.\n\nWe have added the following tests in the file test/sharpness_test.cc:\n1. SharpnessTestLarge\n2. SharpnessAllIntraTest\n3. SharpnessAllIntraTestLarge\n\nWe have currently limited the test cases for cpu-used and sharpness levels to limit the run-time of the tests. \n\nAs per our understanding the config parameter has applicability for kAllIntra mode, mainly. Hence we are testing for only kTwoPassGood  and kAllIntra modes. Please let us know your thoughts.\n\nPlease review.\n\nRegards,\nJayasanker.",
