      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\nThis patch abstracts buffer_removal_time_present flag from AV1_COMMON to AV1_PRIMARY (for encoder) and AV1Decoder (for decoder). buffer_removal_time_present flag gets set when decoder_model_info_present_flag in oxcf-\u003edec_model_cfg is present and is is never reset. This flag is moved out to primary structure since it is constant across all the frames.\n\nThis change is bit-exact and has been locally verified with bitstream match tests over a combination of various configuration values for --threads, --tile-rows, --tile-columns, --cpu-used, --end-usage,  --row-mt, etc. \n\nPlease review.",
