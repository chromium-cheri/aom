      "message": "Should this tile_size_bytes also be made conditional?\n\nSlightly strangely, the tile length code is read as part of the uncompressed header, but in bitstream.c it seems to be written as part of write_frame_header_obu - just outside the uncompressed header.\n\nOn the other hand, the uncompressed_hdr_size is computed including the bits in the tile length code, so it feels like tile length code is conceptually part of the uncompressed header.",

      "message": "tile_size_bytes might be also used when # of tiles \u003d 1. Need to double check that. If it is true, to make it conditional, more change are needed.\n\nNot sure what you mean about tile length? tile_size_bytes is part of uncompressed header. In encoder, it is written later since we don\u0027t know it before packing stream.",
