      "message": "I like the idea of defaulting to always have CDFs with an extra slot at the end for the count.  However, this patch seems like a good way to introduce some confusion when later reading the code.\n\nInstead of MAX_TX_DEPTH + 2 (where MAX_TX_DEPTH + 1 is the length of the CDF and the extra + 1 is the slot), maybe we should use a macro:\n\n#define CDF_SIZE(x) ((x) + 1)\n\nand use CDF_SIZE(MAX_TX_DEPTH + 1) so its clear how many CDF elements there are?",
