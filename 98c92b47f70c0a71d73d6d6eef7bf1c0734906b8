      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\nWe noticed an integer overflow issue in buffer size computation of pack bitstream MT in the nightly tests (only in 32-bit builds) below.\nhttps://build.aomedia.org/jenkins/job/libaom__nightly_unit_tests-sanitized/1078/\n\nThe issue is caused by overflow in a multiplication operation. As size_t datatype is taking 4-bytes in size, the issue seen only in 32-bit build. The issue is fixed by storing the multiplication output in an intermediate 64-bit variable.\n\nThis patch is tested locally for bit match. Please review.\nThank you.",
