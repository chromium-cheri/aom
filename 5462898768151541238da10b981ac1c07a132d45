      "message": "Hi Wan-Teh,\n\nWe have modified the CL as per your suggestions. Also, we observed that the call for av1_cnn_activate_c() is made based on the enum IDENTITY instead of NONE. We have corrected the same and moved this if condition to inside av1_cnn_activate_c(). We verified that the CL is bit-exact and speed-up numbers mentioned remain the same. Please review the CL.\n\nThanks.",
