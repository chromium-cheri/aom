      "message": "I am not familiar with the TEMPMV experiment but it appears that this change just makes the criteria for copying last frame to the cm-\u003eprev_frame buffer match on the encoder/decoder side, and this was a pre-existing issue which isn\u0027t directly related to global motion. If this is the case, I think the commit message should clarify this.",
