      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\n\nIn this patch, we have optimized the memory usage in temporal filter pred buffer by allocating the memory based on the bit-depth and chroma subsampling format. The respective tests are also modified accordingly.\n\nThe observed peak memory reduction is negligible. A potential reason could be that this memory is being allocated and freed within a short time interval, making it difficult to be captured by the profiling tool.\n\nThis patch is verified to be bit-exact with no impact on encode time.\n\nAWCY Link (8bit, cpu-used 1, 60 frames, bit-exact)\nhttps://beta.arewecompressedyet.com/?job\u003d081020_ref_cpu1_8b_master%402020-10-08T12%3A52%3A22.812Z\u0026job\u003d081020_tf_mem_opt_cpu1_8b_master%402020-10-09T07%3A59%3A38.915Z\n\nAWCY Link (10bit, cpu-used 1, 60 frames, bit-exact)\nhttps://beta.arewecompressedyet.com/?job\u003d081020_ref_cpu1_10b_master%402020-10-08T12%3A48%3A35.602Z\u0026job\u003d081020_tf_mem_opt_cpu1_10b_master%402020-10-09T07%3A58%3A51.971Z\n\nPlease review.\n\nRegards,\nJayasanker.",
