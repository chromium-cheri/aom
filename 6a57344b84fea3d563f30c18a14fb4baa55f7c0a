      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\n\nIn this patch we have introduced a new function aom_sum_sse_2d_i16_c which computes the sum of values and sum of squared values of residual block. The existing function (aom_sum_squares_2d_i16_c) computes only SSE but in order to compute the variance and energy of the residual block in a single iteration, along with SSE we also need the sum of the residual values. The corresponding AVX2 and SSE functions are also added along with a test bench to validate the implementation.\n\nThis function will be used in the future patch to bypass tx type search for DC only blocks.\n\nPlease review the patch.\nThankyou.\n",
