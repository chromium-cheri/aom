      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\n\nIn this CL, the FPMT configuration macros, CONFIG_FRAME_PARALLEL_ENCODE and CONFIG_FRAME_PARALLEL_ENCODE_2, are cleaned up from the FPMT unit test related code. The FPMT unit test configuration macro, CONFIG_FPMT_TEST, is now independent and the file test.cmake has also been modified to address the same.\n\nThis patch is bit-exact and has been locally verified with bitstream match test. We have also validated this patch with address, thread, undefined and integer sanitizers.\n\nPlease review.\n\nRegards,\nRemya\n",
