      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\n\nThis CL optimizes the SIMD version of temporal filtering. Currently, the weight calculation in av1_apply_temporal_filter_avx2() is done using floating point C operations. In this CL, we have introduced the AVX2 intrinsic for the same to speed-up the temporal filtering process. At module level, the scaling gains have improved by ~35% (i.e. from 7.9x to 10.5x).\n\nPlease check the encoder speed up results measured using timer and instruction count based as below. Please note timer based results are based on a limited set of test contents and instruction count is measured using Borg test.\n```\n\t                          Instruction Count\ncpu           Resolution        Reduction(%)\n 5             LOWRES2             0.839\n 5             MIDRES2             1.105\n 5             HDRES2              1.354\n 6             LOWRES2             0.476\n 6             MIDRES2             1.028\n 6             HDRES2              1.251\n```\n```\n          Encode Time\ncpu       Reduction(%)\n 5          1.555\n 6          1.539\n```\nThe instruction count reduction specified has been measured using command:\n$ perf stat -e instructions:u ./aomenc â€¦\n\nPlease review the CL.\n\nThanks \u0026 Regards,\nDiksha.",
