      "message": "Thanks for asking these questions.\n\n1. In a major version update (from version x.y.z to (x+1).0.0), we can remove public types, macros, and functions. That\u0027s why this CL is fine for the upcoming libaom 2.0.0 release. However, we still need to avoid inconveniencing libaom clients. Since aom_codec_register_put_frame_cb() and aom_codec_register_put_slice_cb() have always returned an error, it is extremely unlikely that any libaom client is using them. That\u0027s why I propose we remove them in libaom 2.0.0.\n\n2. I had only searched for these symbols in Google\u0027s internal Code Search. I just searched for these symbols using both Google Search and Bing Search, and found no results outside libaom.",
