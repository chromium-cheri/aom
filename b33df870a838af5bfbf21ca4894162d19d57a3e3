      "message": "I am allocating the `mb-\u003edqcoeff_buf` buffer in `av1_alloc_mb_data()`. This is the simplest, but has the downside that the buffer is allocated and deallocated when we encode each frame. But this is a big improvement over statically allocating the buffer in the `MACROBLOCK` structure.\n\nIdeally we just need to allocate and deallocate this buffer once for the entire video sequence.",
