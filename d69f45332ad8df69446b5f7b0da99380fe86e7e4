      "message": "Thanks for the patch. I have a general comment. There are a bunch of test with parameter such as non-real time mode. A parameter is also defined in encode_test_driver.h file -- #define NONREALTIME_TEST_MODES ::testing::Values(::libaom_test::kOnePassGood). Since there is no real-time mode now, having non-realtime modes seems to raise few questions. This is probably not urgent, but if it possible to rename now or in future would be nice. ",
