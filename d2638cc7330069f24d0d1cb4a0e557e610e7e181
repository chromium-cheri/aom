      "message": "Marco: Are you setting every member of the `extra_cfg` struct?\n\nThis function should only set the members that have different values from `default_extra_cfg`.\n\nMy assumption is that the number of such members is relatively small, so setting them in this function allows us to see at a glance which members have different defaults.\n\nIf you need to change the default values of a large number of members, then we should go back to using an alternative `default_extra_cfg`.\n\nBased on your previous attempt (https://aomedia-review.googlesource.com/c/aom/+/192141), the number of members you need to modify should not be large. I counted 33, in addition to the ones that we already modify.",
