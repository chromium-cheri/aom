      "message": "Hi Wan-Teh, Frank,\n\nIn this CL, we have removed the unnecessary memset of ‘mbmi_ext_info-\u003eframe_base’ buffer during its allocation in alloc_context_buffers_ext(). ‘mbmi_ext_info-\u003eframe_base’ buffer is a frame level buffer used to store the mode information during the encode stage. As the best mode information at block level is copied to this buffer from ‘x-\u003embmi_ext’ during the encode stage, this buffer need not be initialized. This is a bit-exact change.\n \nFor AVIF still-image encode with tune\u003dpsnr,\n                 Encode Time \n    cpu-used     Reduction(%)\n       8           0.679  \n       9           1.058\n  \nFor AVIF still-image encode with tune\u003dssim,         \n                 Encode Time \n    cpu-used     Reduction(%)\n       8           0.796  \n       9           1.033\n\nFor libaom AV1 video encode, bit-match is verified (w.r.t. parent commit) for \u0027GOOD\u0027, \u0027RT\u0027 and \u0027ALLINTRA\u0027 encoding modes for a few contents with different encoding configurations. It is verified that the CL is bit-exact for AVIF still-image encode for a typical image dataset.\n\nPlease review the CL. \n\nRegards,\nRemya\n",
