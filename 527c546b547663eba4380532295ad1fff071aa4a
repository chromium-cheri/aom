      "message": "In the parent commit, the allocations of `hist-\u003epts` and `hist-\u003esz` buffers in `init_rate_histogram()` are not checked. In case of allocation failure, this can result in SEGV error when these buffers are accessed in `update_rate_histogram()`. This CL fixes this issue by adding allocation checks at appropriate places.\n\nIn this CL, the allocation failures within `init_rate_histogram()` are not treated as fatal and the encoding continues. However, in order to flag the allocation failure, an error message is shown.\n\nThis change is bit-exact and has been verified using bitstream-match tests for a combination of various configuration values for --threads, --tile-rows, --tile-columns, --cpu-used, --end-usage, --row-mt, --fp-mt, etc. Validated all unit-tests with sanitizers (address and thread) and valgrind.",
