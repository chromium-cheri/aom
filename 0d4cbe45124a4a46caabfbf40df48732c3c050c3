      "message": "The purpose of this change is to add the description of the deltaq-mode\u003d5 for HDR BT2020 streams in aomenc-av1, since it was present in the code documentation, but not in the user-facing encoder.\n\nAs for the temporal dependency model as a prerequisite, it applies to dq\u003d1 and dq\u003d2, not dq3-dq4-dq5, since dq3-dq4 are psycho-visual deltaq modes which only apply to intra use cases. dq\u003d5 does not have any temporal component, so tpl-model isn\u0027t required.\n\nThe statement \"Currently this requires enable-tpl-model as a prerequisite.\" was there all along and never modified, which is why it is still there. \n\nI guess I could add that only dq\u003d1 and dq\u003d2(currently WIP) utilize the tpl-model.",
