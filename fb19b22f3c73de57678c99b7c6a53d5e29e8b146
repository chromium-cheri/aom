      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\n\nIn av1_post_encode_updates(), the check for a frame_parallel_level 2 frame in an FP2 set was happening unconditionally for all frames. This resulted in the runtime error: index -1 out of bounds, for cpi-\u003egf_frame_index \u003d 0. This patch modifies the condition such that the check happens only for frame_parallel_level 2 frames in a parallel encode set which avoids redundant checks and thereby fixes the error.\n\nThis change is bit exact and has been locally verified on a few test cases.\n\nPlease review.\n\nRegards,\nRemya",
