      "message": "Cheng: It seems that if method !\u003d LPF_PICK_FROM_FULL_IMAGE_NON_DUAL, then the result of the first search_filter_level() call at line 271 will be overwritten by the search_filter_level() calls at line 275 and 278. I am wondering if we should rewrite lines 270-280 as follows to avoid doing wasted work:\n\n    if (method \u003d\u003d LPF_PICK_FROM_FULL_IMAGE_NON_DUAL) {\n      lf-\u003efilter_level[0] \u003d lf-\u003efilter_level[1] \u003d\n          search_filter_level(sd, cpi, /*partial_frame\u003d*/0,\n                              last_frame_filter_level, 0, 2);\n    } else {\n      lf-\u003efilter_level[0] \u003d\n          search_filter_level(sd, cpi, method \u003d\u003d LPF_PICK_FROM_SUBIMAGE,\n                              last_frame_filter_level, 0, 0);\n      lf-\u003efilter_level[1] \u003d\n          search_filter_level(sd, cpi, method \u003d\u003d LPF_PICK_FROM_SUBIMAGE,\n                              last_frame_filter_level, 0, 1);\n    }",
