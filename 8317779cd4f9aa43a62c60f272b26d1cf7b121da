      "message": "Hi Yunqing, Wan-Teh,\n\nFloating-point instructions in av1_apply_temporal_filter() led to the MT mismatch, with 32-bit build. This patch adds a call to aom_clear_system_state() in av1_tf_do_filtering_row() before av1_apply_temporal_filter() to ensure match.\n\nWe have verified that all tests in AVxEncoderThreadTestLarge.EncoderResultTest and AVxEncoderThreadLSTestLarge.EncoderResultTest are passing with this change.\n\nIt looks like the issue was not caught earlier with single-thread as thread\u003d0 (master thread) has call to aom_clear_system_state() in the code which is not multi-threaded.\n\nPlease review.\n\nRegards,\nJayasanker.",
