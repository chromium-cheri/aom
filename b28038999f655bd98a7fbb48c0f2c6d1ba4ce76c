      "message": "This #if / #else block breaks the LGT experiment.  Right now it is turned off in configure, but in theory someone could update the LGT transforms to have uniform scaling and then be able to do a comparison with the daala transforms.\n\nMy recommendation is we keep LGT turned off, but make sure not to break the ability to later continue this experiment.  You\u0027ll notice that Debargha was careful not to break our DAALA_DCTX experiments when he merged LGT.",

      "message": "Unfortunately, it is not premature-- we do not pass build verification if the transforms are left in place, as they\u0027re statically defined and not used.  If the #if expression is inadequate/flawed, we need to fix it.\n\nThis is part of what I meant by this level of individual transform configuration granularity quickly becoming very complex.  It even touches the build system for SIMD (as there are now dead functions there that also get flagged).",
