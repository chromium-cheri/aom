      "message": "This #if / #else block breaks the LGT experiment.  Right now it is turned off in configure, but in theory someone could update the LGT transforms to have uniform scaling and then be able to do a comparison with the daala transforms.\n\nMy recommendation is we keep LGT turned off, but make sure not to break the ability to later continue this experiment.  You\u0027ll notice that Debargha was careful not to break our DAALA_DCTX experiments when he merged LGT.",
