      "message": "Yes, you are correct.  However, what is represented in the code has to be a \"merge\" of R18 and any tools that have been adopted that are NOT part of R18  (There are many tools that were adopted prior to R18 and subsequent to R18 that are not part of R18 because there is no updated main spec in synch with the SW).  Because this function has to live in both the \"before R18 (but with new adoptions)\" and \"after R18 (but before new adoptions)\", it is preferable to leave it as is.",
