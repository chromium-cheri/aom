All uses of target_link_libraries with a target\n  must be either all-keyword or all-plain.\n\n  The uses of the keyword signature are here:\n\n   * CMakeLists.txt:295 (target_link_libraries)\n\nNote that the error is pointing at our usage here because I didn\u0027t go through and revert all the removals of the PUBLIC version of the call.\n\nIn the end this usage results in basically the same behavior as public[1].
