      "message": "Hi Sarah, Debargha\nWe have submitted 3 patches to facilitate sub-gop unit tests (sub-gop size, sub-gop position check and pyramid level). The patches have code changes as follows,\n\t\n1. Patch 1 adds control calls in encoder to collect sub-gop stats. Encoder sub-gop stat consists of baseline gf interval, frames_to_key, sub-gop configuration, is_filtered flag and pyramid level.\n2. Patch 2 adds control calls in decoder to collect sub-gop stats. Decoder sub-gop stat consists of disp_frame_idx, show_existing_frame and show_frame flags.\n3. Patch 3 adds hook functions required to handle encode result and decoder input.\n\nSubsequently, we are planning to submit the unit test changes for sub-gop configuration. It will act as a framework to all unit tests related to sub-gop. \nWe have tested the patches locally. Kindly review the same and let us know your thoughts.\n\nThank you.",
