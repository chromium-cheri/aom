      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\n\nThis patch renames the frame type check variable in set_good_speed_features_framesize_independent() appropriately to reflect its actual usage. The condition is also changed to use the correct enum value (INTER_FRAME).\n\nThis is a bit-exact change with no speed impact (verified locally on a few clips).\n\nPlease review the patch.\n\nThanks,\nNithya",
