      "message": "Not sure if \"bit-exact\" (output is exactly same as before) should be expected with this change. \nI believe hash value collision is possible in this case. It happens in hash based ME. That is why we calculate SSD after a matched hash value is found. In this case if the hash value is same but the residual blocks are different, the RD decision will not be optimal. Not sure how bad it is, but the output will not be same.",
