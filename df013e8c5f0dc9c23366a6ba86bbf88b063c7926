      "message": "Not sure if \"bit-exact\" (output is exactly same as before) should be expected with this change. \nI believe hash value collision is possible in this case. It happens in hash based ME. That is why we calculate SSD after a matched hash value is found. In this case if the hash value is same but the residual blocks are different, the RD decision will not be optimal. Not sure how bad it is, but the output will not be same.",

      "message": "Hash collision is possible in theory. But we are only using an 8-slot circular buffer (block.h) to store the hash values. Collision among these 8 hash values is much more unlikely than hash_me, which stores thousands of hash values. The experiment results show no changes on the PSNR and bitrate numbers.",
