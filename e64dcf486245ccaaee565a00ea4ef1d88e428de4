      "message": "This seem like it runs afoul of clang:\nhttps://llvm.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id\u003d24421\n\nThe gist is that it automatically adds a :32 alignment directive to this store, which causes problems.\n\nI\u0027m working around this in a very slow way:\np[0] \u003d vget_lane_u8(a, 0);\n...\np[3] \u003d vget_lane_u8(a, 3);\nbut then a is uint8x8_t, not uint32_t\n\nIt\u0027s so slow I\u0027ll probably check alignment and cast when possible. I asked for a way to hint to clang not to add the alignment directive, but not a whole lot of people are using intrinsics or doing 4x4 transforms.",
