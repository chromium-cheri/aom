      "message": "I think I understand this conflict here. My question is that since we made \"lossless\" a feature at the segment level, should the decision to override frame level TX_MODE with ONLY_4X4 be made at segment level too? i.e. If a frame has multiple segments with at least one lossy segment, should the TX_MODE for the frame be allowed to use TX_MODE_SELECT as default, lossless segments can then override that and uses ONLY_4X4 for those lossless segments only?",
