      "message": "I think the principal of this seems like it might be a good ide so that we can work with the encode either the denoised or raw frame. Whether it is a good idea to encode from the noisy source but still apply the noise synthesis at the decoder remains to be seen and may be very content and Q dependent.",

It also helps mitigate https://bugs.chromium.org/p/aomedia/issues/detail?id\u003d2816 since the noise is synthesised over frames with it possibly removed. \n\nI\u0027ll work on getting some more examples and trying to determine a q threshold for at least a source.",

      "message": "It\u0027s quite beneficial in many ways.\n\nAs my colleague has stated and shown, it offers better detail retention overall.\n\nIt also has other upsides from my testing material: first-pass is significantly faster with enable-dnl-denoising\u003d0, and the rate control doesn\u0027t change as much with that method in place, compared to the normal grain synthesis method.\n\nOf course, normal grain synthesis behavior is better at very low/low bitrates, so keeping it default is a good idea.\n\nI am currently making more testing encodes before giving concrete results, but the preliminary results seem very promising still.",

      "message": "No objection to adding another flag (I\u0027ll leave it to the owners to decide). \n\nHowever, it feels a little odd to be adding back noise that was modeled between original and denoised, back to the original (to potentially fix an issue caused by over-denoising in coding of frames, or to fix an issue with under-estimation of the noise strength in the grain synthesis). E.g., we can end up with a higher displayed frame noise level (which I guess is up to the user). It would be more consistent if the noise was modeled between the original and reconstructed coded frame--not sure how feasible that is.\n\nAnother way to accomplish similar behavior as the flag (e.g., to avoid denoising every pass, and add back whatever noise you want, to any input) is to denoise outside of aom and use examples/noise_model.c to generate the noise parameters and pass those into second pass.",
