      "message": "Hi Vishnu,\n\nThanks for the explanation. I saw the change in av1_alloc_cdef_linebuf() to handle large scale tile case.\n\nYou added\nuint8_t prev_cdef_enable_flag;\nunsigned int prev_large_scale_tile_flag;\nint prev_num_planes;\nto handle cdef linebuf allocation and freeing. I am not quite convinced that the above elements are necessary?\n\nWe had memory allocation in cdef before https://aomedia-review.googlesource.com/c/aom/+/134681. We didn\u0027t need to store prev flags before. Why is this necessary now? What is different about alloc_cdef_linebuf added for CDEF MT?\n\nCherma and Ranjit, could you also take a look and help me understand it? Thanks.\n",
