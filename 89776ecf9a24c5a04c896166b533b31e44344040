      "message": "Hi Wan-Teh, Frank,\n\nAs discussed in the review comments of the CL (https://aomedia-review.googlesource.com/c/aom/+/155361/comments/2204e65d_1fddff49), we have simplified some operations by making use of the CEIL_POWER_OF_TWO macro at some places based on the applicability. \nIn this CL we have replaced the following operations with CEIL_POWER_OF_TWO(x,n):\n1. (x + (1\u003c\u003c n ) - 1) \u003e\u003e n\n2. ALIGN_POWER_OF_TWO(x,n) \u003e\u003e n\nWe have verified that these refactoring changes will not cause any behavioral changes. \n\nFor libaom AV1 video encode, bit-match is verified (w.r.t. parent commit) for \u0027GOOD\u0027, \u0027RT\u0027 and \u0027ALLINTRA\u0027 encoding modes for a few contents with different encoding configurations. It was also verified that the output of AVIF encode is bit-exact w.r.t. parent version for a typical image dataset.\n\nPlease review.\n\nRegards,\nMudassir.\n",
