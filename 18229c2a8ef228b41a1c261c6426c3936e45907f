      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\n\nWe have submitted patch set 2 by mapping the new conservative logic introduced in patch set 1 as sf level 1 and existing aggressive logic as level 2. As per your suggestion we have reverted the change for speed 10. Currently sf is set to level 1 for speed 7 and 8, disabled for speed 9 and level 2 for speed 10. Also we have rebased the patch set 2 and generated the results for speed 7 and 8. Please note that enabling the sf for speed 9 level 2 gives performance improvement within trade-off result, let us know your opinion on enabling the same.\n\nPlease check the resolution-wise speed and quality results as mentioned below.\n\n                    Instruction Count        BD-Rate Loss(%)       \ncpu-used Resolution   Reduction(%)    avg.psnr   ovr.psnr    ssim  \n   7        rtc         -0.154        -0.1137    -0.1387   -0.1526 \n   7      rtc_derf      -0.219        -0.0896    -0.0558   -0.0521 \n   7      Average       -0.186        -0.1037    -0.1042   -0.1108 \n   8        rtc          0.709         0.0458     0.0457    0.0862 \n   8      rtc_derf       2.564        -0.0515    -0.0340    0.0386 \n   8      Average        1.614         0.0052     0.0125    0.0663  \n \nIn the commit message :\n[-] sign indicates encode time increase \n[+] sign indicates encode time reduction \nThe instruction count reduction specified has been measured using command:\n$ perf stat -e instructions:u ./aomenc â€¦\n\nPlease review the patch.\nThank you.",
