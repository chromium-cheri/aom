So the nightly test fails:\nhttps://build.aomedia.org/jenkins/job/libaom__unit_tests-multi-target/2393/\n\nI wrote a simple fix in https://aomedia-review.googlesource.com/c/aom/+/172801 to exclude this test in realtime only build. I don\u0027t know if this test works with `::libaom_test::kRealTime`.\n\nSince this file seems to test the realtime mode only (see line 260 and the use of `::libaom_test::kRealTime` above), perhaps this test should not be in this file.",
