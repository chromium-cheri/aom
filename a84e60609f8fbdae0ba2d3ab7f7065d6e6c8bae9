      "message": "It seems that the larger blocks are probably be a bit faster, but everything else seems to be in the margin of error.\n\nI suspect that some of the smaller blocks are slightly slower (1% ish at the high end) on the microbenchmarks. That being said, I don\u0027t really trust microbenchmarks to properly measure the real world impact of unrolling a bunch of loops.\n\nI did take some measurements of the time svc_encoder_rtc took w/ and w/o changes. The latest run I did seemed to be maybe a tiny bit faster, but that could just as well be due to better branch prediction due to branches being put in slightly different places.",
