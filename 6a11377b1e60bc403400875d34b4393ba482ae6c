      "message": "So, this patch seems to have modified the `--sharpness` tuning parameter, and no documentation update has been done in this regard. \n\nAlso, this line has been changed from \nconst int rshift \u003d sharpness + 2; \nto const int rshift \u003d 2;\n\nAny reason for doing this? All of these changes make it so that we can\u0027t really tune the RD towards higher fidelity in exchange for more artifacts.",
