      "message": "Hi Konstantinos,\n\nI just realized that much of the code in this function comes from `av1_apply_temporal_filter_c()`. So in this CL it would be better to faithfully match the code in `av1_apply_temporal_filter_c()`, and then we can simplify and clean up the code in all the  `av1_apply_temporal_filter_*()` functions in a separate CL.\n\nI am going to take a closer look now and may go back to an earlier patchset of this CL.",
