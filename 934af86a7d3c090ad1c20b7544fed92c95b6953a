      "message": "It would be good to document the meaning of the bitmasks in these three arrays.\n\nIt is also not clear to me what \"derived\" and \"reduced\" means.\n\nFor a concrete example of a comment that will help me: it would be helpful to say av1_derived_intra_tx_used_flag is used when use_reduced_intra_txset \u003d\u003d 2 as an additional filter to rule out more transform types. The result is to \"search the transform kernels that are derived from residual stats model\" (quoted from your commit message).",
