For symmetry, it seems that we should also set the C and C++ standards flags for MSVC.\n\nMSVC doesn\u0027t have a flag for C standards. (One reason may be that it still doesn\u0027t fully support C99.) So we can only set the C++ standard, and the minimum C++ standard version we can set is C++14.",
