      "message": "Urvang, Is it right inference that this patch has merge conflict. I see following 4 files have changed if I have do a comparison between the current merged anchor and this patch. On top of decode frame.c and bitstream.c, config.py and utils.py has changed. I don\u0027t see those changes listed in this patch? Whats the best way to resolve, \"Rebase\" and merge again? Does it need to pass nightly and other test after rebase. ",

      "message": "Yes, this shows merge conflict now.\nSo, best way is to rebase this patch (locally using command-line) and push rebased patch again. (Child patches need to be rebased as well).\nNote: sometimes the \"merge conflict\" detection here maybe incorrect, and if you are lucky, there may be no conflicts locally.\nP.S. To avoid these kind of issues, it\u0027s best to submit whole chain together in the future (by clicking \"submit including parents\" on last patch: https://aomedia-review.googlesource.com/c/aom/+/135761).",
