These SFs are enabled only for resolutions \u003c 480p. Please find the detailed borg results below,\n\n               Instruction Count        BD-Rate Loss(%)\ncpu Resolution   Reduction(%)    avg.psnr   ovr.psnr    ssim\n 2     LOWRES2      4.340        -0.0896    -0.1026   -0.2241\n 2     MIDRES2     -0.007         0.0007     0.0005    0.0020\n 2     HDRES2       0.000         0.0000     0.0000    0.0000\n 2     Average      1.444        -0.0296    -0.0340   -0.0741\n\nIn the commit message :\n[-] sign indicates encode time increase \n[+] sign indicates encode time reduction \n\nThe instruction count reduction specified has been measured using command:\n$ perf stat -e instructions:u ./aomenc â€¦ \n\nPlease note that stats changed observed for a content (shields_640x360_60) in midres since clip height \u003c 480. For the content we ensured that result is within trade-off. We also verified bitmatch for other speed levels.\n\nPlease review the patch.\nThanks",
