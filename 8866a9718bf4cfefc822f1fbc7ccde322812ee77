      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\n\nWe have uploaded another patch that improves the trade off for this SF. In this patch, the SF forces transform type to be DCT_DCT, if its probability is greater than a certain threshold(150) , else forces the transform type with maximum probability if it exceeds a higher threshold (250).\nIf both the thresholds are not met, the transform type is not forced. We have chosen a lower probability threshold (150) for DCT_DCT, as we saw that the average number of transform types evaluated during mode evaluation (MODE_EVAL) is around 1.2 and DCT_DCT is evaluated about 75% to 85% of the times and is seen to win 85% of times.\n\nPlease find the results of the current experiment below.\n\n                      Instruction Count     BD-Rate Loss(%)\ncpu-used  Resolution   Reduction(%)     avg.psnr  ovr.psnr   ssim   \n  6       LOW RES        3.656          0.6813     0.702     0.7653\n  6       MID RES        2.431          0.3392     0.3484    0.2728\n  6        HD RES        0.000          0.0000     0.0000    0.0000\n  6       Average        2.427          0.3735     0.3845    0.3878\n\n\nPlease note that lowres SSIM is slightly out of trade off in the above result.
