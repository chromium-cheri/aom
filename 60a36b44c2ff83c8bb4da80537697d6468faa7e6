      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\n\nThis patch introduces a new pruning level to prune_mesh_search speed feature. This level conservatively enables the prune_mesh_search based on q index and a conservative mv_diff threshold. We observed a significant scope and a good trade-off, when enabled in the motion search called from the temporal filtering module. Hence the new level is enabled only for this module in speed-3. We have also verified that there are no major worst case drops. The worst case drop is about 0.891% for station2_480p25 clip.\n\nPlease find the detailed borg result below,\n\n               Instruction Count        BD-Rate Loss(%)\ncpu Resolution   Reduction(%)    avg.psnr   ovr.psnr    ssim\n3     LOWRES2      0.954         0.0172     0.0097    0.1030\n3     MIDRES2      1.408         0.0120     0.0242   -0.0135\n3      HDRES2      1.082        -0.0112    -0.0241   -0.0145\n3     Average      1.148         0.0060     0.0033    0.0250\n\nIn the commit message, BD rate impact column: \n[+] sign is for BD-Rate drop \n[-] sign is for BD-Rate improvement \nThe instruction count reduction specified has been measured using command: $ perf stat -e instructions:u ./aomenc â€¦\n\nWe have locally verified that the changes are bit-exact for all other speed levels. Please review the patch.\nThanks",
