      "message": "This is actually intended. Sub-8x8 blocks are handled a little differently from regular (8x8 and larger) blocks. Take 4x4 sub-blocks in a 8x8 partition block as an example: w\u003d2(instead of 1), step\u003d1. For block 0 and 2, x\u003d0, x+step\u003d1\u003cw\u003d2, so has_right\u003dtrue; for blocks 1 and 3, x\u003d1, x+step\u003d2\u003dw, so has_right\u003dfalse. If we do the way as in this CL, has_right will always be false for 4x4 blocks.",
