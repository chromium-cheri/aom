      "message": "Currently in libaom, the number of frames considered for arf frame filtering are limited or adjusted based on  q index, arf-boost and a speed feature \u0027num_frames_used_in_tf’. In this CL, we have introduced a speed feature \u0027adjust_num_frames_for_arf_filtering\u0027 to adjust the frame count based on the noise level of the current frame. The adjustment is done such that a low-noise frame considers more frames to provide a filtered frame which can be used for better prediction and vice versa for high-noise frames.  Currently, the sf is enabled only for speed 6.\n\nThe following experiments were done to limit/adjust the number of frames considered for temporal filtering of an ARF frame.\n\n- Experiment 1: Number of frames is adjusted based on the noise level of the current frame as mentioned above.\n```\n                    Instruction Count        BD-Rate Loss(%)       \ncpu   Resolution      Reduction(%)    avg.psnr   ovr.psnr    ssim\n 6      LOWRES2         0.929        -0.1159    -0.0290     -0.1116\n 6      MIDRES2         2.712        -0.1585    -0.0486     -0.1077\n 6      HDRES2          2.613        -0.0819    -0.0050     -0.0460\n 6      Average         2.085        -0.1188    -0.0275     -0.0884\n```\n\n- Experiment 2: Currently, in libaom the speed feature \u0027num_frames_used_in_tf\u0027 is used to limit the number of frames for filtering based on quantization value and noise_level. The logic here suggests to lessen the number of frames for all noise levels when the quantization value is higher. The following is the result when disabled the sf ‘num_frames_used_in_tf\u0027\n```\n                    Instruction Count        BD-Rate Loss(%)       \ncpu   Resolution      Reduction(%)    avg.psnr   ovr.psnr    ssim\n 6     LOWRES2         -1.893        -0.1626    -0.2849     -0.2324\n 6     MIDRES2         -0.068        -0.0152    -0.0157     -0.0186\n 6     HDRES2           0.000         0.0000     0.0000      0.0000\n 6     Average         -0.654        -0.0593    -0.1002     -0.0837\n```\n- Experiment 3: ( Experiment 1 + Experiment 2)\nFrom experiment 2, it is seen that the speed feature \u0027num_frames_used_in_tf\u0027 is providing the results which are within the acceptable trade-off limits. However, the logic used in Exp2 seems to be conflicting with Exp1.\n\n The newly added sf \u0027adjust_num_frames_for_arf_filtering\u0027 logic helps in terms of both speed and quality. Whereas, the existing sf \u0027num_frames_used_in_tf\u0027 helps only LOWRES2 speed. Thus, we propose Exp1 + Exp2 i.e. enabling the new sf while disabling the existing logic.\n```\n                   Instruction Count        BD-Rate Loss(%)       \ncpu   Resolution     Reduction(%)    avg.psnr   ovr.psnr    ssim\n 6     LOWRES2         0.092        -0.3476    -0.3376     -0.4707\n 6     MIDRES2         2.681        -0.1642    -0.0546     -0.1130\n 6     HDRES2          2.613        -0.0819    -0.0050     -0.0460\n 6     Average         1.795        -0.1979    -0.1324     -0.2099\n```\n\nThe instruction count reduction specified has been measured using command:\n$ perf stat -e instructions:u ./aomenc …\n\nWe verified that the CL is bit-exact for speed \u003c\u003d 5.",

      "message": "\u003e Also, does this same logic apply to key frame temporal filtering?\n\nApplying this logic for key frames gives a small speed-up \u003c0.4% with many contents dropping \u003e1% (BD Rate). Thus, we suggest not enabling it for key frame.\n\n\u003e Would be good to have this for lower speeds.\n\nA direct extension of this sf to cpu 5 does not give an acceptable speed Vs BD Rate trade-off. We shall work on making this logic conservative for cpu 5.\n\n\u003e Did you try to make the decision also based on qp? We already have a qp decided for arf at this point, right?\n\nThe parent version already has a logic to reduce the number of frames for ARF using \u0027gfu_boost\u0027 that is calculated through \u0027av1_calc_arf_boost()\u0027. This logic indirectly depends on QP. As you mentioned, \u0027arf_q\u0027 is available at this point. We shall study this with some experiments.",
