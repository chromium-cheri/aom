      "message": "I don\u0027t see any/much effect of this motion constraint, for either speed 7 or 9 on rtc set. Was there more effect on rtc_derf?\n\nThe avg_frame_low_motion, for the current frame, is updated after this function in\nav1_cyclic_refresh_postencode(). May be good to try moving avy_adjust_gf_refresh to right afterav1_cyclic_refresh_postencode(), to see if it changes anything\n\nAlso note we do already force GF refresh when frame has very significant content/motion change (via high_source_sad).",

      "message": "This condition helps few high motion clips that exist in both rtc \u0026 rtc_derf sets.\n\nYes, it is logically right to move av1_adjust_gf_refresh_qp_one_pass_rt after av1_cyclic_refresh_postencode. However, rc-\u003eavg_frame_low_motion is an accumulated value over frames. Feel that we probably wouldn\u0027t see much difference. I can try it. \n\nFrom what I saw, \"high_source_sad\u003d1\" happens much less than \"rc-\u003eavg_frame_low_motion \u003c 20\". That is why I chose to use avg_frame_low_motion.\n\nThanks for the comments.",
