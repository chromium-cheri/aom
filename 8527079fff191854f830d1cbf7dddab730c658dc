      "message": "For the one pass mode\nWith this CL, the key frame locations are|\n1:I\n    --\u003e missing 51:I \n67:I\n83:I\n98:I\n114:I\n130:I\n146:I\n\n51:I is missing because the define_kf_interval() assumes the current frame will not be the keyframe. Therefore, frames_to_key starts at one.\nThis is true for two pass mode. However, for one pass mode, we call define_kf_interval at the beginning of each GOP. If the first frame of the GOP should be key frame, we will miss that.\n\nAnyway, I will come-up with a follow-up CL to address that part if you guys think it\u0027s okay to check this in first.\n\nWithout this CL, the key frame locations are\n1:I\n52:I --\u003e off by one error\n67:I\n83:I\n98:I\n114:I\n130:I\n146:I\n\nI guess there is still some corner cases that I didn\u0027t notice.",
