      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\n\nThe assert failure was observed in nonRD all intra configuration. Earlier mi_rows/mi_cols were calculated based on width/height aligned to a multiple of 8 luma pixels. For the 160x90 clip the last mi line is completely outside of conformance dimensions resulting in assert failure. The issue was seen in all intra configuration as 4x4 transforms are enabled. We have fixed the issue by using mi_cols/mi_rows calculated based on width/height aligned to MI_SIZE (4 luma pixels). \n\nPlease review.\n\nThanks",
