      "message": "In global motion, a frame with the layers of the pyramid is populated using av1_resize_plane() and each layer is populated with a downscaling factor 2. In order to ensure the layer dimension even, only the even number of samples in horizontal and vertical direction are considered for downscaling.\n\nThis CL introduces a function av1_resize_plane_to_half() with the necessary conditions from av1_resize_plane(). The newly introduced function performs resizing in horizontal and vertical directions through resize_horz_dir() \u0026 resize_vert_dir() functions respectively and both the functions make use of down2_symeven() as the input layer dimensions are even.\n\nThis change is bit-exact with no impact on the encode time.",
