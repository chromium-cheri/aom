      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\nThis patch fixes a compile time warning with CONFIG_FRAME_PARALLEL_ENCODE\u003d1 in the local reference to ppi-\u003ecpi in encoder_encode().\n\nCurrently, local cpi is initialized before jmp_buf is set and would be swapped with another parallel cpi during a frame_parallel_level\u003d2 frame. If a longjmp call comes after the swap, the value of cpi would be undefined. Therefore, moved the init of local cpi after jump point is set.\n\nThis change is bit-exact and has been locally verified with bitstream match tests over a combination of various configuration values for --threads, --tile-rows, --tile-columns, --cpu-used, --end-usage,  --row-mt, etc.\n\nPlease review.",
