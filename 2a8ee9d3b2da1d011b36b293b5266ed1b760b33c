      "message": "\nHi Yunqing,\n\nThis patch creates temporary variables for last_q, avg_q, active_best_quality and last_boosted_qindex, in PRIMARY_RATE_CONTROL (under CONFIG_FRAME_PARALLEL_ENCODE macro).These are previously obtained frame q related values which are consumed in stats consumption stage. In order to ensure that all the frames in a parallel encode set start with the same values, this patch disables the end-of-frame store for these variables for the frames, except for the last frame in a parallel encode set.\n\nThis change is done only for VBR path. It is tested locally with cqp bitmatch and verified with integer sanitizer test. The cumulative quality impact of all the CLs in this dependent chain are given at https://aomedia-review.googlesource.com/c/aom/+/140064\n\nPlease review this patch.\nThanks",
