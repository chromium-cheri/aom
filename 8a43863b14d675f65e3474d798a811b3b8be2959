      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\n\nWe have added SSE2 implementation for 12-tap x-convolve, i.e. av1_convolve_x_sr_c\nfor MULTITAP_SHARP2 case. The change has been verified to be bitexact locally and\nthrough testbench. We have also added support to AV1ConvolveXTest to test bitmatch\nfor the newly added function, and a new Speed test to check Module level gains for\nall x-convolve intrinsics.\n\nThe encode-time reduction for all presets are as follows:\n\n   cpu        Encode time\n   used       reduction(%)\n    0            0.45\n    1            0.38          \n    2            0.26          \n    3            0.20          \n    4            0.45         \n    5            0.43          \n    6            0.42          \n\nThe above data is obtained on an Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4770R machine with gcc-7.4.\n\nWe are also planning on adding SSE2 variants for Y-convolve as well as 2D convolve\nin future patches.\n\nKindly review this patch.\n\nRegards,\nVishesh\n",
