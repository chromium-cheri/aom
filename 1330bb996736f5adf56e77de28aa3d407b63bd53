      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\nThis patch abstracts output_pkt_list from cpi to AV1_PRIMARY(ppi). There were some places in the existing codebase where output_pkt_list was expected to be null for LAP. Since this element is now abstracted and common to both cpi and cpi_lap, it will not be null. To accommodate this behavior, this patch adds code to check if the context accessing output_pkt_list is not a LAP context before it does so.\n\nThis change is bit-exact and has been locally verified with bitstream match tests over a combination of various configuration values for --threads, --tile-rows, --tile-columns, --cpu-used, --end-usage, --row-mt, --passes etc. \n\nPlease review.",
