      "message": "Hi Yunqing, pls see the linked MR on AVM side. Due to the wrong YUV file dimension, one decoder multithreading issue was NOT caught. Fixing the dimension revealed the bug.\nSo, it seems worthwhile to use current input dimension to avoid regressions.\n\nFor testing larger resolution, probably better to use a real input with larger dimension?",

Let me know what you think.",
