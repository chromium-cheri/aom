      "message": "It just occurred to me that we may need to increment AOM_CODEC_ABI_VERSION in this CL because all the codec control IDs are renumbered. I don\u0027t know if we also need to increment AOM_DECODER_ABI_VERSION and AOM_ENCODER_ABI_VERSION.\n\nIf we increment the AOM_xxx_ABI_VERSION macros, we should do that on the master branch to ensure a monotonically increasing sequence of ABI versions, and then cherry-pick the CL to the braeburn branch. I think it is also better to renumber the codec control IDs on the master branch first to avoid merge conflicts.\n\n",
