      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\n\nThis patch makes the functions that allocate memory for loop filter, CDEF and loop restoration modules non-static to aid the follow-up CL that subsumes all multi-threaded modules related initializations under the FPMT framework.\n\nAlso, the interface of alloc_cdef_buffers() is modified to include a flag to indicate whether cdef_worker (AV1CdefWorkerData) allocation is to be done or not. This is to ensure that in the subsequent CL, when alloc_cdef_buffers() is called for a parallel frame, cdef_worker should not be reallocated for the fewer no. of threads. As an example, if we have total 8 threads and 2 parallel frames, then level 0 frames will be processed by all 8 workers while level 1 and level 2 frames will be processed by 4 workers each. In alloc_cdef_buffers(), cdef_worker is reallocated for a frame whenever there is a change in the no. of workers, which should not happen for parallel frame encode. The newly introduced flag init_worker helps to decouple the initialization of cdef_worker from the rest of the initializations inside the function, thereby ensuring that unwanted re-initialization of cdef_worker would not occur for a parallel frame (more details are present in the dependent CL).\n\nPlease review the patch.\n\nThanks,\nNithya",

      "message": "The flag init_worker is introduced to ensure that decoder behaviour is not affected. Now reallocation happens if cdef_info-\u003eallocated_num_workers !\u003d num_workers and init_worker \u003d 1 (when called from decoder, init_worker is always passed as 1). In the encoder side, we need to control the reallocation based on whether the frame is a parallel frame or not. For parallel frames, reallocation of cdef_worker need not happen. The follow-up CL contains the change where there are separate calls for parallel frames where init_worker is made 0, so that only cm buffers and cdef_sync are initialized.",
