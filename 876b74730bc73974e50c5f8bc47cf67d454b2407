      "message": "This CL adds AVX2 intrinsic for aom_comp_avg_pred_c() and also adds the relevant unit test.\n\nFollowing shows the timer based module level scaling seen for different block sizes.\n```\nBlock_Size    Scaling w.r.t. C (x)\n    8x8             5.06\n    16x16           4.68\n    32x32           3.79\n    64x64           2.75\n   128x128          1.22\n```\nFor this patch, ~0.5% instruction count reduction is seen with the older GCC compiler (v7.5), whereas negligible speed-up is seen with the latest GCC compiler (v11.3). Seems like the code is optimized well by the latest compiler. Hence, this optimization could be useful in older GCC compilers.",
