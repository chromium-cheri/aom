      "message": "The multiplication by number of transform blocks is needed when the skip is decided for the full transform tree when transform is split. The search_tx_type() function operates at the transform block level and the decision is not made at the transform tree level. However, for normal modes, when search_tx_type() is called, for faster speed settings, only no_split transform block is evaluated and hence the multiplication factor is 1 (since the predict_dc_only_block() is called for smaller than 64x64 blocks, block size will be same as transform size for those modes). For winner mode, transform search happens for no_split and split blocks and hence this factor will not be 1 when txfm split is evaluated for winner modes.",

      "message": "So, your fix works since predict_dc_block is turned off now for winner mode. But, this wouldn\u0027t be true if predict_dc_block is turned on later for winner mode, right? Do we need to modify this to support that as well? What do you think?",
