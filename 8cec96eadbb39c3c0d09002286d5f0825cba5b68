      "message": "Sorry for the late reply. My concern is that the decision to do temporal average here is based on the whole superblock\u0027s temporal variance (64x64 or 128x128), and so if the whole superblock has low tmp_variance, but there is some small portion that is moving, then there could be visual artifacts.\n\nI think the test clip checked has very low content/high quality, so may not be best one.",

      "message": "Yes, as I mentioned, there is more to do in this area. Block size is 1 thing on the todo list. For rtc set, the resolution is relatively high, using SB size is still fine, especially for those with static background. For small resolutions or being more precise, small blocks should be used. This is also why this is only enabled for rtc set. The thresholds used is very conservative, the block wouldn\u0027t be filtered if there is moving portion.\n\nRegarding the test clip, I used the one that got the most coding gain(5+%). That is the typical clip that can get gain from this. Anyway, if you see anything different, please let me know.",
