      "message": "The version of the code prior to this commit checked __ARM_FEATURE_CRC32 in the code but never actually checked that the correct -march flag was set, so would be silently ignored if e.g. `-march\u003darmv8-a` was passed as the architecture to use. I imagine that checking that the flag is supported is sufficient here, but let me know if you would prefer to also be checking the __FEATURE_FLAGS going forward as we add detection for more features?",
