      "message": "James: Please feel free to ignore these comments. I got curious about this last night because I didn\u0027t know what exactly \"stub\" means, even though I have heard of the term \"stub function\" (the stub functions in the import libraries of Windows DLLs).\n\nAfter learning about \"stub\", I found that \"stub function\", \"stub source file\", and \"stub library\" in this CL differ from the common meaning of these terms.",

      "message": "Nit: \"stub\" isn\u0027t a good replacement here. Among the suggested alternatives at https://source.android.com/docs/setup/contribute/respectful-code, \"no-op\" seems the best. We could also consider \"empty\", \"null\", or \"void\". \"Empty\" seems especially suitable for describing the source file because ideally we want the file to be empty, but the compiler or linker won\u0027t allow that.\n\nIn some cases, such as the comment here, we can also just delete the word.",
