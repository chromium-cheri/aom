      "message": "Thank you for the answer.\n\nIt\u0027s just that I think only checking with metrics(especially PSNR) is not a good way of doing things psycho-visually speaking. I\u0027ve noticed that ever since I\u0027ve joined aomenc-av1 development back in 2019.\n\nThat results in trying to optimize coding gains without taking into account of how it will affect human perception, for good or for better :P",
