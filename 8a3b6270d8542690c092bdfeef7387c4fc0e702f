I\u0027ve noticed that ever since I\u0027ve joined aomenc-av1 development back in 2019.\n\nThat results in trying to optimize coding gains without taking into account of how it will affect human perception, for good or for better :P",

      "message": "Yeah, I agree with you.\nVisual quality is important. However, visual quality is hard to measure if there is no objective metric. For measurable metrics like ssim, here is my opinion.\n\nHere, what we are doing is given a measurable metric, design algorithms to optimize it.\nFor now, the entire AV1 encoder is measuring sum of square error (PSNR) for each encoding modes and pick the best one.\nUnder this framework, out goal should be picking the algorithms that minimize the chosen metric (PSNR). There might be some side effects for other metrics like ssim etc, but it doesn\u0027t mean the algorithm is bad.\n\nWe can also make the encoder to track ssim and use the same algorithm to optimize it. Theoretically, it should work as well, but it\u0027s hard to achieve that given the status of current codebase.\n\nI didn\u0027t mean we don\u0027t care about ssim. We will come back to it. But, it\u0027s hard to make everything work at once.",

      "message": "Thank you again for the wonderful answer.\n\nHowever, I have a general request regarding coding/psycho-visual performance analysis: I would prefer an approach similar to how the AWCY platform does it where it shows you a lot of metrics so that more balanced choices can be made. I mean, there are already multiple aomenc runs on AWCY from here, so it should not be problematic.\n\nYou need multiple metrics to get a real picture of how changes affects the output, not just a single one where in the long term, we tend to optimize for it.\n\nSorry if a merge request thread is the ground for talking, but I haven\u0027t really found a good way to actually discuss this with AOM devs directly, be it on an IRC channel where there isn\u0027t much discussion, or the AOMEDIA mailing list which is apparently difficult to get in even though we are talking about the development of an open standard?\n\nStrange really, but that is all I have to say for now.",
