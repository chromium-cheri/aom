      "message": "Users of `aom_codec_error_detail()` may not know about the lifetime of the returned string. This CL is intended to help libaom users avoid this bug.

When `aom_codec_destroy()` frees the error detail buffer, it can\u0027t set the outstanding  pointers to that buffer to null, so I came up with this idea.\n\nI tested this CL with the heif-enc command-line program of libheif.\n\nI don\u0027t know how to build libheif with AddressSanitizer enabled.\n\nIn my experiment, the use-after-free of the error detail string did not result in a crash. The error detail message was intact after the error detail buffer was freed. So this bug could not be easily detected.",
