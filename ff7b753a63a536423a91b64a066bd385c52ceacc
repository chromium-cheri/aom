      "message": "I have a question: `av1_resize_and_extend_frame_{ssse3, neon}` fallback to `av1_resize_and_extend_frame_c()` for the cases that `av1_has_optimized_scaler()` returns false, but `av1_resize_and_extend_frame_c()` calls `aom_scaled_2d()` which also have ssse3 and neon optimized version. From the comments in `aom_scaled_2d()` it can handle any scale ratio \u003e\u003d 1/4. Is there any reason you completely avoided using it?",

      "message": "Yuan: I found the answer to your question. It is related to the `work_w` and `work_h` parts of your CL (including the fallback on `aom_scaled_2d_c()` for nonstandard working area sizes). So your CL doesn\u0027t undo what Jerome did in this CL but rather is an alternative solution.",
