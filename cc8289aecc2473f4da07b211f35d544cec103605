(read_uncompressed_header() processes a frame header OBU.)\n\nConsider the following sequence of OBUs:\n  1. Sequence header OBU\n  2. Frame header OBU\n  3. Different sequence header OBU\n  4. Tile group OBU\n\nToday we will attempt to process the tile group OBU, potentially using the new sequence header in conjunction with some state based on the old sequence header. It seems better to declare the bitstream as invalid after processing the new sequence header (#3).",
