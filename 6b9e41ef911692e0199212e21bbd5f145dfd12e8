      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\n\nThis patch introduces a flag do_frame_data_update to indicate frames that would update the relevant data to the primary context at the end of the encode. It is set for non-parallel frames and the last frame in encode order in a given parallel encode set. This flag would be used and updated in stat consumption stage and set to default true for stat generation stages.\n\nThis is a facilitation patch for future changes which will enable/disable update of frame elements to primary context related to cross-frame dependencies in encoding.\n\nWe have internally tested this patch for the tests mentioned below with the CONFIG_FRAME_PARALLEL_ENCODE macro set to 1 and num_fp_contexts set to 4. This change is bit-exact and has been locally verified with bitstream match tests over a combination of various configuration values for --threads, --tile-rows, --tile-columns, --cpu-used, --end-usage, --row-mt, etc. \n\nPlease review.
