      "message": "Hi Wan-Teh, Frank,\n\nThe structure \u0027dv_costs\u0027 is used to hold the cost of signalling the dv in the bitstream in case of intraBC mode. This patch allocates \u0027dv_costs\u0027 only when intraBC mode needs to be evaluated. This patch essentially delays the allocation of ‘dv_costs’ until the sfs are finalized and a decision has been made on whether to evaluate intraBC or not. When the sf use_nonrd_pick_mode \u003d 1, control exits early from rd_pick_intrabc_mode_sb(). Hence, ‘dv_costs’ is not used in such cases and therefore the allocation is avoided.\n\nWe have also cleaned up the piece of code corresponding to the allocation of dv_costs in the case of first-pass (for worker threads in multithreaded use-case) where the intraBC tool is not evaluated. This, along with the conditional allocation (where the allocation is avoided for first-pass in the main thread) gives a marginal heap memory reduction in the first-pass stage.\n\nFor libaom \u0027GOOD\u0027 usage with cpu-used \u003d 6 –passes\u003d2 –pass\u003d1,\n\n                   HEAP Memory reduction(%)\n                      Single      Multi\nResolution    Tile    thread      thread\n1920x1080     4x2      0.14        0.90  (8 threads)\n\nFor libaom AV1 video encode, bit-match is verified (w.r.t. parent commit) for \u0027GOOD\u0027, \u0027RT\u0027 and \u0027ALLINTRA\u0027 encoding modes for a few contents with different encoding configurations. It was also verified that the output of AVIF encode is bit-exact w.r.t. parent version for a typical image dataset.\n\nHEAP memory reduction was measured using the command below. \n$valgrind --tool\u003dmassif ./aomenc …\n\nPlease review.\n\nRegards,\nJayasanker.\n",
