      "message": "There are a lot of files in this CL, but there are only three kinds of changes.\n\n1. Please review test/encode_test_driver.{h,cc} first. The SetMode() method is subsumed by the InitializeConfig() method.\n\n2. Replace the InitializeConfig() + SetMode(mode) call sequence with InitializeConfig(mode). A representative example is test/active_map_test.cc.\n\n3. Remove the assignments that set g_lag_in_frames and rc_end_usage to their current values, just set by InitializeConfig(mode). A representative example is test/arf_freq_test.cc. Please let me know if you prefer to keep the explicit assignments for clarity or emphasis.\n\nThank you!",

      "message": "Sorry for the delay, Wan-Teh,\nThe change looks good to me, but it touches almost all test sources by eliminating SetMode() (merging it into InitializeConfig()). May be someone in the team had better understanding if there were reasons to make those two functions separate? But if there were/are no reasons to keep them separate - please ship it :-))\n\nThanks,\n-Fyodor",

      "message": "Hi Fyodor,\n\nThanks for the review! The git history of libaom shows that the declarations of InitializeConfig() and SetMode() were last modified in 2013 and 2012, respectively. The person who last modified the declarations of these two methods, John Koleszar. is no longer working on libaom. So I sent an email to the libaom team at Google about this proposed change. I will wait until this Wednesday for feedback.\n\nI also created a code-review-helper CL at https://aomedia-review.googlesource.com/c/aom/+/130763.",
