      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\n\nThis patch refactors malloc and free calls of srcbuf, linebuf and colbuf buffers in cdef_info structure. We also removed several variables in cdef_info structure that are used to track change in configuration at frame level. Reallocation of buffers are simplified as per the suggestion given by Wan-Teh Chang.\nThank you.",
