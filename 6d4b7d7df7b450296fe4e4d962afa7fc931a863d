      "message": "Ranjit: Could you clarify this comment?\n\nSince the commit message says \"The increment of the stats_in pointer is moved to\nav1_twopass_postencode_update\" and the only thing moved in this CL is the if-else statement at lines 3979-3983, I guess this comment is referring to that if-else statement. But that if-else statement does not look like an increment of the stats_in pointer. On the other hand, line 3978 decrements the stats_in pointer, so there is an apparent contradiction between this comment and line 3978.\n\nAlso, do you know why it is safe to decrement cpi-\u003etwopass_frame.stats_in? How do we know cpi-\u003etwopass_frame.stats_in \u003e twopass-\u003estats_buf_ctx-\u003estats_in_start before the decrement?",
