The test should be parameterized on the functions so other variants can easily be brought in. A DISABLED_Speed test would also be welcome. The first change in the set should introduce the test with C coverage only, then the sse4 can be brought in.\n\nhttps://aomedia.googlesource.com/aom/+/master/test/variance_test.cc#1302\nhttps://aomedia.googlesource.com/aom/+/master/test/convolve_test.cc#1256",
