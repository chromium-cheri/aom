      "message": "This isn\u0027t the first test in this style, but no new ones should be brought in this way. The test should be parameterized on the functions so other variants can easily be brought in. A DISABLED_Speed test would also be welcome. The first change in the set should introduce the test with C coverage only, then the sse4 can be brought in.\n\nhttps://aomedia.googlesource.com/aom/+/master/test/variance_test.cc#1302\nhttps://aomedia.googlesource.com/aom/+/master/test/convolve_test.cc#1256",

      "message": "Ok, I\u0027ll change the test to take function pointers for the tested functions.\n\nI don\u0027t think I understand your other comment about doing this in two patches. This test is checking that the SSE4 code gives the same answer as the C code, which it takes as a sort of golden reference. There wouldn\u0027t be any point in just running one function.",

      "message": "The test now passes in the tested convolve function by pointer. It\u0027s slightly different from the ones to which you linked because there isn\u0027t a different function for each size, so we\u0027re calling the same function with several sizes rather than calling a different function for each test. I agree this is worth doing: if someone writes an AVX2 version, it should be easy to plumb in. There isn\u0027t any point in parameterising on the C \"reference\" function though.\n\nOnce I\u0027ve finished writing the highbd version, there will be another patch on top of this which reuses lots of the infrastructure in av1_convolve_scale_test.cc (but with slightly different types, which is why there\u0027s all the ugly templating: I\u0027ll rip out any excess generality as part of that patch).",
