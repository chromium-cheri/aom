      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\n\nThis patch enables encode reordering of gf-interval 14 in order to facilitate FP2. Encode order is changed such that the frames in the same layer depth are encoded consecutively. Due to the limitation on the maximum possible number of hidden frames at any given point(REF_FRAMES - 2, considering the steady state where 2 past frames of pyramid-level 1 are needed), this kind of reordering is feasible only for gf-intervals \u003c 15. Currently this reordering is done only for gf-interval 14 as it will aid in parallel encode of two layer 4 frames.\n\nPlease review.\n\nRegards,\nRemya",
