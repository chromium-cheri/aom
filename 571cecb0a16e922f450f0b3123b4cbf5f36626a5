      "message": "In the parent commit, `rusi` and `rsc.dgd_avg` buffers are allocated locally in `av1_pick_filter_restoration()` and freed at the end of the function. In case of an early termination between this allocation and free call, this will show up as a leak. In order to fix this issue,these pointers are added in the newly created structure `AV1LrPickStruct`. This structure is introduced as a member in AV1_COMP so that it can be freed in `encoder_destroy()` in case of early termination. In order to facilitate this refactoring, `RestUnitSearchInfo` structure has been moved from `pickrst.c` to `encoder.h`.\n\nThis change is bit-exact and has been verified using bitstream-match tests for a combination of various configuration values for --threads, --tile-rows, --tile-columns, --cpu-used, --end-usage, --row-mt, --fp-mt, etc. Validated all unit-tests with sanitizers (address and thread) and valgrind.",
