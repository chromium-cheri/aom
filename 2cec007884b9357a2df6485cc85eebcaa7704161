      "message": "Hi Wan-Teh, Frank,\n\nIt was observed that the unit-test for testing SCC tools with multi-threaded encoding was not being invoked during the nightly thread sanitizer runs in Jenkins. While checking the command used for triggering these runs, we observed that the “--gtest_filter” option is configured as *Thread*Large*:*FrameParallel* for thread-sanitizer configuration whereas the unit-test name was “ScreenContentToolsTestLarge.ScreenContentMultiThreadedEncoding”, which was not falling under the specified filter.\n\nThis CL moves the existing test for SCC tools with multi-threaded encoding to a new test suite ScreenContentToolsMultiThreadTestLarge so that the same gets invoked during the nightly thread sanitizer tests. This test had been introduced in the following CL:\nhttps://aomedia-review.googlesource.com/c/aom/+/156486\n\nPlease review.\n\nRegards,\nJayasanker.\n",
