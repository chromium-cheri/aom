      "message": "Hi Wan-Teh, Frank,\n\nIt was observed that the unit-test for testing SCC tools with multi-threaded encoding was not being invoked during the nightly thread sanitizer runs in Jenkins. While checking the command used for triggering these runs, we observed that the “--gtest_filter” option is configured as *Thread*Large*:*FrameParallel* for thread-sanitizer configuration whereas the unit-test name was “ScreenContentToolsTestLarge.ScreenContentMultiThreadedEncoding”, which was not falling under the specified filter.\n\nThis CL moves the existing test for SCC tools with multi-threaded encoding to a new test suite ScreenContentToolsMultiThreadTestLarge so that the same gets invoked during the nightly thread sanitizer tests. This test had been introduced in the following CL:\nhttps://aomedia-review.googlesource.com/c/aom/+/156486\n\nPlease review.\n\nRegards,\nJayasanker.\n",

      "message": "Hi Jayasanker,\n\nThis is just for future reference: The nice introductory messages you wrote for your CLs often contain valuable information that I think should be included in the commit messages. For example, in this message, the --gtest_filter option\u0027s value *Thread*Large*:*FrameParallel*  is crucial to understanding why the old test name doesn\u0027t match the pattern but the new test name does. It would be good to include that in the commit message.",
