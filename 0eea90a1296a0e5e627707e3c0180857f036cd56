      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\n\nThis patch disables luma loop restoration for low and high qindex ranges for non-boosted, non-internal-arf frames in speed 4. This is based on our observation on LR search results that the chance of RESTORE_NONE winning was high in LF_UPDATE and overlay frames in the low and high qindex range.\n\nPlease find the detailed borg results below.\n\n         |            | Instruction Count |        BD-Rate Loss(%)       |\ncpu-used | Resolution |    Reduction(%)   | avg.psnr  ovr.psnr   ssim    |\n-------- | ---------- | ----------------- | --------  --------  -------- |\n   4     |  LOW RES   |       1.358       |  0.0510    0.0597    0.0631  |\n   4     |  MID RES   |       1.654       |  0.0629    0.0718    0.0831  |\n   4     |   HD RES   |       1.834       |  0.0858    0.0944    0.1155  |\n   4     |  Average   |       1.551       |  0.0651    0.0738    0.0850  |\n\n\nIn the commit message, BD rate impact column:\n[+] sign is for BD-Rate drop\n[-] sign is for BD-Rate improvement\nThe instruction count reduction specified has been measured using command:\n$ perf stat -e instructions:u ./aomenc â€¦\n\nFor other speed levels, this is a bit-exact change with no speed impact (verified locally on a few test cases).\n\nPlease review the patch.\n\nThanks,\nNithya",
