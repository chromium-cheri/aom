      "message": "Hi Wan-Teh,\n\nWhile analyzing the heap memory map from AVIF encoder, we observed that the buffer rst_tmpbuf is allocated even when the loop restoration filter is not enabled. In this patch, we allocated this memory conditionally based on loop restoration sf. We introduced ‘is_restoration_enabled()’ to handle the specific cases related to LR filter.\n\nFor libaom AV1 video encode, bit-match is verified (w.r.t. parent commit) for \u0027GOOD\u0027, \u0027RT\u0027 and \u0027ALLINTRA\u0027 encoding modes for a few contents with different encoding configurations. It was also verified that the output of AVIF encode is bit-exact w.r.t. parent version for a typical image dataset.\n\nWe validated the heap memory reduction for cpu-used 6, 9 with threads \u003d4,\n\t\t\t          \n cpu-used     Resolution    HEAP Memory reduction(%)\n    6\t       360p-720p          13.31\n    9\t       360p-720p          13.36\n\nThis patch is also applicable for \u0027GOOD\u0027 and \u0027RT\u0027 encoding modes when loop restoration filtering is not enabled.\n\nFor libaom \u0027RT\u0027 usage with cpu-used \u003d 5,\n\n Resolution    Tile   HEAP Memory reduction(%) \n 832x480       2x1      2.98 (2 threads)\n 640x360       2x1      4.09 (2 threads)\n 1280x720      2x2      4.23 (4 threads)\n 1920x1080     4x2      4.79 (8 threads)\n\nFor libaom \u0027GOOD\u0027 usage with cpu-used \u003d 6,\n\n Resolution    Tile   HEAP Memory reduction(%) \n 640x360       2x1      1.44 (2 threads)\n 832x480       2x1      0.93 (2 threads)\n 1280x720      2x2      1.51 (4 threads)\n 1920x1080     4x2      1.68 (8 threads)\n\n\nHEAP memory reduction was measured using the command below. \n$valgrind --tool\u003dmassif ./aomenc …\n\nPlease review this patch.\n\nThanks \u0026 Regards,\nVenkata.",
