      "message": "For NEAREST_NEARESTMV, NEAR_NEARMV, NEW_NEWMV, and GLOBAL_GLOBALMV, we have m1\u003d\u003dm2, so they may be either both ranked as No. 1 or both as No. 2 in terms of the single mode distortion.\n\nFurther, we have total 8 compound modes for RD evaluation: besides above 4, we have NEW_NEARESTMV, NEAREST_NEWMV, NEW_NEARMV, and NEAR_NEWMV. If the top 2 single modes are skipped, we may skip up to 50% compound modes. It may be worth further exploring the trade-off between coding performance and speed for various strategies to skip the compound modes.",
