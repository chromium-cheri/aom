      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\nWe have added a call to aom_clear_system_state() before double operations in get_num_refs_to_disable() to avoid issues with 32-bit build. When we tested the parent version locally, we did not observe any failures. This could be due to aom_clear_system_state() calls in other parts of code. However we feel that adding this call would help in avoiding issues in future.\n\nPlease review.\nThank you.",
