      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\nWe have identified root cause for bit mismatch issue observed in “Consolidate skip extended comp mode speed features” patch. In skip_inter_mode function, skip_compound_using_best_single_mode_ref() should be involved only if “prune_extended_comp_mode \u003e 1”. We have updated relevant code in this patch. \n\nThe BD rate issue is fixed. We also ensured that the changes are bit-exact across all speed preset.\n\nPlease review the patch\n\nRegards\nAkshata",
