      "message": "some question in general:\n1. do you plan to include this experiment as part of extended quantization proposal or put it in a separated proposal? I suggest to merge it into the the existing proposal.\n2. does this proposal change the decoder normative behavior? since when the final qindex\u003d0, decoder will treat the block as lossless coded. so this change will only impact how encoder choose the minimum qindex, is it correct?",
