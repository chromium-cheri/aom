      "message": "In this patchset I have chosen to leave the left_row and left_col variables uninitialized. A good compiler should be able to figure out that it is safe to use left_row and left_col when left_mv_valid is 1. So I tweaked the conditional expressions to make it more obvious to the compiler. Clearly this approach is sensitive to the inner workings of the compiler\u0027s static analysis.\n\nAn alternative solution is to simply initialize left_row and left_col, ideally to an invalid motion vector value (-32768) instead of 0.\n\nPlease let me know if you prefer the alternative approach.",
