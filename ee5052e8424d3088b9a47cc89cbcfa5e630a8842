      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\n\nWe benchmarked the subpel_force_stop speed feature and observed that\nspeed quality trade-off is poor with QUARTER_PEL. In order to improve \nthe trade-off, we submitted the patch to set subpel_force_stop as \nEIGHTH_PEL for speed 5, 6.\n\nPlease find the detailed borg result below.\n\n CPU   Test Set   Instruction Count    BD-Rate Loss %\n                    Reduction %   avg.psnr ovr.psnr   ssim\n  5        rtc        -2.652      -1.8193  -1.5443  -1.3214\n  5   rtc_derf        -1.374      -0.7708  -0.6009  -0.3348\n  5    Average        -2.029      -1.3824  -1.1512  -0.9103\n  \n  6        rtc        -2.441      -1.8827  -1.6338  -1.4138\n  6   rtc_derf        -0.960      -0.6911  -0.5339  -0.3528\n  6    Average        -1.718      -1.3862  -1.1755  -0.9717\n\nIn the commit message, BD rate impact column:\n[+] sign is for BD-Rate drop \n[-] sign is for BD-Rate improvement. \nThe instruction count reduction specified has been measured using command: \n$ perf stat -e instructions:u ./aomenc â€¦ \n\nPlease review the patch. \n\nThank you.",
