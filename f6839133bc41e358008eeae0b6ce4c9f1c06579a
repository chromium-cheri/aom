      "message": "The skip_ctx is for the entire coding block skip mode. At this point, one only tests luma component. It is not clear if chroma would throw in non-zero coefficient - I guess that would be content dependent.\n\nAt any rate, my take is that either way probably won\u0027t affect the compression performance significantly (?) If this approach ends up with better coding performance, it looks fine to me.",

      "message": "The other way is remove this skip check here, and only get the minimum of RDCOST(x-\u003erdmult, rd_stats-\u003erate, rd_stats-\u003edist) and RDCOST(x-\u003erdmult, 0, rd_stats-\u003esse) and compare with ref_best_rd for the valid cost, and let callers handle the skip check together with luma and chroma. I also don\u0027t think this will affect the compression performance significantly, it is just comparing with zero_rate in the original code is not correct.",
