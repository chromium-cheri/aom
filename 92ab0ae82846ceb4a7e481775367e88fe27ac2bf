      "message": "Hi Wan-Teh,\n\nAs per your suggestions, we have renamed the existing file end_to_end_test.cc with end_to_end_psnr_test.cc and also removed the file end_to_end_test.h to make both ssim and psnr unit-tests independent. We have not pursued the cleanup which is possible in the existing end_to_end_psnr_test.cc (related to kWidth/kHeight/kFramerate used in YUVVideoSource), as it is not related to this patch.\n\nPlease review the patch.\n\nRegards,\nJayashri.",
