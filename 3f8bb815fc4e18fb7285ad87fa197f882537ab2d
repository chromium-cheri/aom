      "message": "In this Patchset, we have disabled tuning for cpu 5 HDRES - it is currently bit-exact. It is observed that some block/state-level info is needed while pruning rect partitions for HDRES content of cpu 5 and possibly also for cpu 4. We plan to take it up in a separate CL, since this can be handled better with refactoring / sending a new flag.",
