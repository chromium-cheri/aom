      "message": "Nit: It would be good to explain what the \"worst case\" update frequencies. Does it mean the smaller or bigger update frequency?\n\nIn fact, it may be better to use a more precise term (\"smaller\" or \"bigger\") instead of \"worst case\", which can be misinterpreted. For example, one can argue that the bigger the update frequency is, the more expensive it is to update the entropy costs, therefore the bigger update frequency is the worst case.\n\nIn addition, it would be good to explain why the smaller or the bigger update frequency should be used as the unified update frequency.",
