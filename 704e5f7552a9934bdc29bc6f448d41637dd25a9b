      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\nIn this patch, a structure AV1_SEQ_CODING_TOOLS is created that holds copies of elements from AV1_COMMON that remain same across frames. Since AV1_COMMON is used by both encoder and decoder, these elements are not abstracted out of AV1_COMMON. Therefore, an instance of AV1_SEQ_CODING_TOOLS is kept in AV1_PRIMARY (seq_coding_tools).\n\nThe initializations of seq_coding_tools have been moved out to new functions (init_config_seq(), av1_change_config_seq() and av1_update_film_grain_parameters_seq()) that get called during creation of ppi (av1_create_primary_compressor()). cpi makes a copy of these elements before it\u0027s initializations (init_config(), av1_change_config() and av1_update_film_grain_parameters()).\nAdditionally, changes are made to av1_get_global_headers() to use sequence headers from ppi and not from cpi.\n\nThis change is bit-exact and has been locally verified with bitstream match tests over a combination of various configuration values for --threads, --tile-rows, --tile-columns, --cpu-used, --end-usage,  --row-mt, etc. \n\nPlease review.",

      "message": "The elements that are copied in the new structure remain same across all frames. Accessing it using ppi-\u003ecpi-\u003ecommon.seq_params works for current implementation with 1 cpi. To facilitate frame parallelism they needed to be refactored to AV1_PRIMARY. Since currently they are part of AV1_COMMON, which is used by decoder as well, a copy is created in ppi instead of abstracting out. This original copy will be used for all updates during encoder config change and other cpi will make a copy of this.",

      "message": "Yes, we will be having 1 cpi per frame later and seq_params will be constant for each frame, hence the existing way of config change will cause each cpi to update its version of seq_params. Though this is functionally correct when frame parallelism will be enabled, we feel that keeping a copy of these parameters in ppi will ensure that the updates are in a single place aiding readability and consistency across cpis. This will also help in the initialization of new elements/structures that will be abstracted to ppi (https://aomedia-review.googlesource.com/c/aom/+/135325 and https://aomedia-review.googlesource.com/c/aom/+/135326). Without this copy of seq_coding_tools in ppi, the initialization of those elements will become scattered across/delayed. \nPlease let us know your opinion.",
