      "message": "In this CL, a `longjmp` target has been introduced in `pack_bs_worker_hook()` to facilitate the error propagation in case of pack bitstream multithreading.\n\nA flag `pack_bs_mt_exit` is introduced in the structure `AV1EncPackBSSync` which will be set to true in case a main/worker thread encounters an error. The other workers will terminate their jobs by checking the status of this flag.\n\nThis change is bit-exact and has been verified using bitstream-match tests for a combination of various configuration values for --threads, --tile-rows, --tile-columns, --cpu-used, --end-usage, --row-mt, --fp-mt, etc. Validated all unit-tests with sanitizers (address and thread) and valgrind",
