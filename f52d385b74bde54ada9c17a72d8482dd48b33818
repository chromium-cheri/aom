      "message": "Hi Wan-Teh,\n\nIn this patch, we have added AVX2 variant of 2x2 convolve (for layer 1 and layer 2) for av1_cnn_convolve_no_maxpool_padding_valid_c() function.\n\nFor libaom AV1 encode, bit match is verified (w.r.t parent commit) to few videos for speed presets 0 to 6. Even though STATS_CHANGED at minimal is expected, we found that streams are bit-matching during our tests.\n\nIt was verified that output of AVIF encode is bit-exact with parent version for a typical image dataset.\nFollowing are the gains observed for speed 3 and 6.\n\n          Encode time reduction (%)     BD-Rate Loss (%)\ncpu-used  QP\u003d{18,33,48,63}    QP\u003d18     avg.psnr    ssim\n    3           0.89          0.42      0.00        0.00\n    6           2.17          1.95      0.00        0.00\n\nThe Encode time reduction specified has been measured using command:\n$ /usr/bin/time -v ./avifenc â€¦\n\nPlease review.\n\nRegards,\nAniket.",
