      "message": "In this CL, a `longjmp` target has been introduced in `fp_enc_row_mt_worker_hook` to facilitate the error propagation in case of multithreading of firstpass encode.\n\nA flag `firstpass_mt_exit` is introduced in the structure `AV1EncRowMultiThreadInfo` which will be set to true in case a main/worker thread encounters an error. The other workers will terminate their jobs by checking the status of this flag.\n\nDuring firstpass encode MT, due to top-right dependency, the worker on a firstpass block-row waits for the completion of the encode of the top-right block. Hence, in case a thread (main/worker) encounters an error,  in order to avoid the dependent workers from waiting indefinitely (in `av1_first_pass_row()`) `set_firstpass_encode_done()` is invoked before returning from the hook function. \n\nThis change is bit-exact and has been verified using bitstream-match tests for a combination of various configuration values for --threads, --tile-rows, --tile-columns, --cpu-used, --end-usage, --row-mt, --fp-mt, etc. Validated all unit-tests with sanitizers (address and thread) and valgrind.",
