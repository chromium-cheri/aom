      "message": "It is not really needed for compiling the current codebase. However for the sake of this header file, it does use some definitions that are not declared (e.g. EncodeFrameInput in line 96). \n\nIf we do not include encode.h in this header file, we are relying on the condition that pass2_strategy.h is always included after encoder.h is included (which is true in our current codebase). \n\nI just thought it wouldn\u0027t hurt to include it here, but you are right it is not required. Please let me know your thoughts on this and I\u0027ll remove this line if it is unnecessary.",
