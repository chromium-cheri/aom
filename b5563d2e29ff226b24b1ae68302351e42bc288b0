      "message": "1. The entropy nodes here for the EOB_NODE, ZERO_NODE, and ONE_NODE (PIVOT_NODE constrained set). \nRight now only the constrained set is coded as a symbol and adapts (ZERO_TOKEN eventually needs to be dynamically merged into that set, EOB gets elided in some cases so that\u0027s trickier).\nSo it seems confusing to me that we are updating EOB_NODE standard weight and ZERO_NODE at increased weight.\n2. Even if that is the right thing to do shouldn\u0027t the TG derived weight be used rather than \"1\" where we want standard updates?",
