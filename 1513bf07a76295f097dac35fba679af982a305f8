      "message": "Hi Jerome, \n\nAs per our understanding, above change would not have any impact and is not required due to the following reasons.\n1) When sb_size \u003d\u003d 128X128 and SB is not split, the complete 128x128 block is filtered by inferring information first mi of the superblock, refer - av1_cdef_compute_sb_list().\n2) CDEF strength information is signaled only once (for SB) in this case as it is signaled at block level, refer - write_mbmi_b() -\u003e pack_inter_mode_mvs() -\u003e write_cdef(). \n\nHence we feel that it is not required to overwrite the skip flags of the remaining blocks. \n\nPlease let us know your opinion on our understanding.\n\nRegards,\nRanjit",

      "message": "Re 1), speed 9 and 10 pick cdef strength values from QP, so ```av1_cdef_compute_sb_list``` is not used. But I don\u0027t think it matters for this CL.\n\nRe 2), I agree. If the 128x128 SB is not splitted, that\u0027ll be only called once (which is called per coding block) and the rest of CDEF strength values are ignored.\n\nIf that\u0027s the case, then this CL doesn\u0027t change anything when 128x128 SB is not splitted; but it fixes the overwrite issue when 128x128 SB is splitted. Is this where the coding gain comes from?\n\nBTW is the instruction count increased or decreased?\n\nBesides that, I think it\u0027s better to do visual test with CDEF changes as the metrics are not a good indicator here.",
