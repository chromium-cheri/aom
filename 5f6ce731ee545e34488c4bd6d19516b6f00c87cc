      "message": "I think this should be thought of as a first pass at changing the costing that shows its significance as a lever. The gains for the hd and screen are certainly good in the context of a 3% slow down and it may be possible to optimize out some of that extra cost. I suspect the new code though may be over rating the cost for lower resolutions.",
