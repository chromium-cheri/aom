      "message": "We get a very odd reverse psnr graph for the static screen clip with this change where the higher the target rate the better the PSNR but the lower the output rate (within the range of rates tested). However, I think this is a feature rather than a bug as the higher target rate allows a faster drop to the min allowed Q and is thus more efficient. ",
