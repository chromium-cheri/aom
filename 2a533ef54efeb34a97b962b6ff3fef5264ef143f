      "message": "This negated conditional followed by a bunch of list(REMOVE_ITEM) calls is pretty rough from a readability perspective: source files should only be added to the lists when a controlling flag is enabled unless absolutely necessary. \n\nFor instance that appears to be the case for CONFIG_REALTIME_ONLY. For CONFIG_AV1_HIGHBITHDEPTH that doesn\u0027t appear to be the case. Not a big deal, but list(REMOVE_ITEM) calls really shouldn\u0027t be necessary at all. \n\nAnyway, no action needed here. Just an observation.",
