      "message": "Could you check if these two lines should also be executed when we reallocate `ppi-\u003eparallel_frames_data[i].cx_data` to a larger size?\n\nI am wondering if they only need to be initialized once. I am not familiar with the frame parallel encoding code, so I don\u0027t know what we should do here.\n\nThanks.\n\nUPDATE: I looked into this a little. I found that `frame_display_order_hint` is initialized to -1 here and then never used. So we can delete it.\n\nAs for `frame_size`, it is harder to analyze. But it seems that we will re-initialize it to 0 before using it, so we don\u0027t really need to initialize it to 0 here. Or we can say it is harmless to initialize it here. Please double check. Thanks!",
