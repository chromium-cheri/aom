      "message": "Hi James,\n\nAs you have pointed out in the patch (https://aomedia-review.googlesource.com/c/aom/+/155366), aom_process_hadamard_lp_8x16() function is specific to low-bd and need not be called for high-bd path. Hence, in this patch the function call is modified appropriately to avoid it in the high-bd path.\n\nWe observed ~2% encode time reduction (with speeds \u003e\u003d 7) for high-bd path as the function call is now avoided. We have also verified that the change is bit-match w.r.t. parent commit for both low and high bit depth paths. \n\nPlease review the patch.\n\nThanks \u0026 Regards,\nVenkata.",
