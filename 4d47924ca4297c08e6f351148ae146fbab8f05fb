      "message": "Hi Neeraj,\n\nIn this CL you changed \"ext_partition_allowed\" to \"partition4_allowed\" in this sentence. But this sentence no longer makes sense.  The first word in this sentence, \"This\", is referring to \"partition4_allowed\". So this sentence is now saying:\n\n```\n  This (partition4_allowed) is almost the same as partition4_allowed, ...\n```\n\nCould you take a look and suggest how to fix this?  Thanks.\n\nI think we can simply remove \"This is almost the same as partition4_allowed, except that\".\n\nIt seems that \"ext_partition_allowed\" was replaced by \"prune_ext_part_state\". So another possible fix is to somehow work \"prune_ext_part_state\" into this sentence.\n\nAlso, I suggest we move the declaration of \"partition4_allowed\" (lines 3963-3966) after this comment block, as in the original code. It can be combined with lines 3984-3985.",
