      "message": "Hi Wan-Teh / Jingning,\n\nIn this patch, TPL buffers are allocated conditionally based on lag_in_frames. When lag_in_frames \u003c \u003d1, TPL module is not invoked. Hence, relevant TPL buffer allocations are avoided accordingly.\n\nFor libaom AV1 encode, bit match is verified (w.r.t parent commit) for few videos for the following cases.\n1) Good Quality (--good): speed presets 0 to 6 with lag_in_frames equal to 0, 1 and 35.\n2) Realtime (--rt): speed presets 0 to 9 with lag_in_frames equal to 0 and 1.\n\nIt was verified that output of AVIF encode is bit-exact with parent version for a typical image dataset. \n\nFollowing are memory reduction results when AVIF encode was tested for ‘building.jpg’ (4032x3024) image for 4 threads at cq_level\u003d18.\n   Speed                 HEAP  Memory\n   preset                Reduction(%)\n    3           ~63.9 (from 1413.26 MB to 508.88 MB)\n    6           ~65.0 (from 1389.75 MB to 485.78 MB)\n\nHEAP memory reduction (Maximum resident set size) was measured using the command below.\n$command time -v ./avifenc ...\n\nPlease review.\n\nThanks \u0026 Regards,\nVenkata.",
