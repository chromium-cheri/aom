      "message": "...but, in the old version, we *also* set args-\u003ecompmode_interinter_cost to equal the same rate cost. Later in the rdopt loop, we will end up adding args-\u003ecompmode_interinter_cost to the estimated rate. So it feels like we used to double-count this cost, but I\u0027d appreciate someone double-checking.\n\nThe one thing I do know: before this patch, on a test video, every single compound block was mis-costed overall. That stays the same if you apply this whole patch except for this one-line change. With this change, about 35% of compound blocks are costed correctly. Ideally this would be 100%, but 35% is about the same as the baseline without ext-inter - ie. the rest is due to other rdopt bugs.",
