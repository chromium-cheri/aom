      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\nThis patch abstracts elements of RATE_CONTROL(cpi-\u003erc) to RATE_CONTROL_PRIMARY(ppi-\u003erc). The relevant initializations have also been moved to their corresponding *_primary counterpart functions. The parameter num_lap_buffers is not needed for create_context_and_bufferpool as well as av1_create_compressor now, and hence, their interfaces have been cleaned up as well.\n\nThis change is bit-exact and has been locally verified with bitstream match tests over a combination of various configuration values for --threads, --tile-rows, --tile-columns, --cpu-used, --end-usage, --row-mt, etc. \n\nPlease review.",
