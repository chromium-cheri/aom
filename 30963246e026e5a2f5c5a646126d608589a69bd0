      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\n\nIn this patch, we cleaned up the sf \"fast_dia_search_level\" by introducing the new search method FAST_BIGDIA.\nAnd also this patch removes the setting of tpl search method in rt path which is not needed.\n\nThis is a bit exact change with no speed impact. (Verified locally)\nAWCY link for speed preset 6:\nhttps://beta.arewecompressedyet.com/?job\u003dref_cpu6_master%402020-07-20T12%3A02%3A18.910Z\u0026job\u003dmod_cpu6_p2_master%402020-07-20T12%3A59%3A24.260Z\n\nAWCY link for speed preset 5 (RT path):\nhttps://beta.arewecompressedyet.com/?job\u003dref_rt_cpu5_master%402020-07-20T12%3A03%3A09.303Z\u0026job\u003dmod_rt_cpu5_master%402020-07-20T12%3A35%3A33.268Z\n\nEven though we introduced this as a new search method, please note that the search methods BIGDIA, FAST_DIAMOND, FAST_BIGDIA are all same with number of search steps as difference.\n\nPlease review the patch.\n\nThanks \u0026 Regards,\nVenkat.",
