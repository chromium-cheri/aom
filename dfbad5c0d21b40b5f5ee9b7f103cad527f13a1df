      "message": "Jingning, do you think it\u0027s correct for unit_count here to only include the unit blocks which are within the frame. e.g., if min_block_size\u003d\u003d8 and the TPL stats have a 32x32 block, normally unit_count would be 4*4 \u003d\u003d 16. But if that block goes extends the right edge of the frame so that only half of it is in the frame, unit_count will now be 4*2 \u003d\u003d 8.\n\nI\u0027m assuming that this is correct, i.e., that the intra_error and inter_error should only be allocated to the unit blocks which are within the frame, but I\u0027d like to know if you agree.\n\nPlease let me know if my explanation here isn\u0027t clear.",
