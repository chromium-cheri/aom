      "message": "I reduced the number to as few as possible still hardly no loss.  I then tried 50 different combinations and picked a set which gave a gain (compared to 32 values) for both ll4 and hl4 (2-3 sets of the 50 tried gave gains), but after a rebase only ll4 gave a gain and hl4 gave a small loss), so there is a noise range here.  The effect on ll0 and hl0 is similar, but I\u0027ve kept the cpu-used\u003d0 case unchanged.",
