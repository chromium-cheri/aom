      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\n\nIn this patch we have corrected the initialization of \u0027skip_mode_cost\u0027 (in av1_fill_mode_rates()) by moving the function av1_initialize_rd_consts() after the variable \u0027skip_mode_flag\u0027 is initialized.\n\nThis change is bit-exact for single thread case, as av1_fill_mode_rates() is called again in av1_set_cost_upd_freq(). However, this change fixes the run to run mismatch observed in the multi-thread scenario when mode-cost-upd-freq is 2 (tile level).\n\nAlso, code related to the unused variable \u0027type_cost\u0027 in \u0027GlobalMotionInfo\u0027 structure is cleaned up.\n\nPlease review.\n\nThanks",
