      "message": "The change looks OK; maybe the loops could be merged if a register was used for the index (meaning set an index variable to 1 after the first loop for the dqcoeff/rounding lookup), though you would pickup the unnecessary MAX.\n\n0.5% is somewhat in the realm of noise, especially in a non-targeted test; a micro-benchmark on the functions would be better if the encodes are taking many minutes. I don\u0027t seem to hit this path (with an abort()), but note 3 encodes 2 with this and 1 with the parent ran at 421/413/412s with avx2 disabled.\n\nIn the future it would be best if you included your environment details and exact encode command line in the comments so the change can be independently verified.",
