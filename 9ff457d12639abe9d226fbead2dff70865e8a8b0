      "message": "Hello Marco and Wan-teh,\n\nI am not sure if this is the correct way to fix this as it seems like a direct revert of https://aomedia-review.googlesource.com/c/aom/+/151201, which would not make much sense. My best guess would be that it should be merged with is_frame_level_cost_upd_freq_set(), but I am not entirely sure. If Marco has a patch, I am fine with immediately closing this one in favor of that\n\nThanks,\nChris",
