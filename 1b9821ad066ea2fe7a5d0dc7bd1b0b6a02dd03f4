      "message": "James: There are two design decisions that I\u0027d like to run by you.\n\n1. Whether we should add both signed and unsigned versions of these load_unaligned functions.\n\nI propose that we only add the unsigned versions of the load_unaligned functions. In my testing, the compiler seems to perform the unsigned-to-signed conversion without warnings.\n\n2. In which header file should we declare these load_unaligned functions.\n\nI was originally planning to declare these functions in either aom_mem/aom_mem.h or a new header in aom_mem/. But when I searched for existing load_unaligned functions, I found this u32_load_unaligned function already defined in the various \naom_dsp/simd/v64_intrinsics_*.h headers. So I added u16_load_unaligned and u64_load_unaligned to here.\n\nThe aom_dsp/simd/v64_intrinsics_*.h headers are not included directly. They are included indirectly via aom_dsp/aom_simd.h. It may not be obvious to people that they would find load_unaligned functions in aom_dsp/aom_simd.h, but it is somewhat reasonable because we often do unaligned loads in SIMD code.\n\nWhat do you think?",
