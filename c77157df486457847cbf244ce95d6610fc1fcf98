      "message": "I am still seeing some build error even with your change. for example, when I enable clpf and dering, I saw aom_clpf_block function and od_filter_dering_direction/orthogonal_4x4/8x8 functions are not available. it seems they are not linked with correct C implementation when all asm implementation is disabled. not sure what happened. I am using VS2012. it seems some script should generate correct function table based on whether asm is enabled or not. but the script is not working properly in my case. do you know what could be wrong?",
