      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\n\nWe added a speed feature to prune NEARMV and NEAR_NEARMV modes based on q-index and reference frames of the neighboring blocks. \n\nWe observed that NEARMV and NEAR_NEARMV modes help in saving bits which can be of lesser importance at high bitrates. Hence, these modes are pruned based on q-index and the reference frame information of the neighboring blocks. For lower q indices modes are pruned when the reference frames of either above/left block does not match with the current block. For q indices in the mid range, NEARMV and NEAR_NEARMV modes are pruned when the reference frames of both above and left blocks do not match with the current block. For higher q indices these modes are not pruned. \n\nThis speed feature is enabled for speed \u003d 6.\n\n                      Instruction Count       BD-Rate Loss(%)\ncpu-used  Resolution     Reduction %     avg.psnr  ovr.psnr  ssim\n   6        LOW RES        2.778          0.3198    0.3248   0.3044\n   6        MID RES        1.410          0.2338    0.2259   0.1178\n   6         HD RES        1.977          0.3267    0.3306   0.3066\n   6        Average        2.241          0.2967    0.2976   0.2505\n\n\nIn the commit message, BD-Rate Loss column:\n[+] sign is for BD-Rate drop\n[-] sign is for BD-Rate improvement\nThe instruction count reduction specified has been measured using command:\n\n$ perf stat -e instructions:u ./aomenc ...\n\nPlease review the patch.\n\nThank you",
