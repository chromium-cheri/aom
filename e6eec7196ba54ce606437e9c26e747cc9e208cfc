      "message": "The reason these C system headers are included here is that they are conditional includes. The Style Guide has an exception for conditional includes:\n\nhttps://engdoc.corp.google.com/eng/doc/devguide/cpp/styleguide.md?cl\u003dhead#Names_and_Order_of_Includes\n\n  Exception:\n\n  Sometimes, system-specific code needs conditional includes.\n  Such code can put conditional includes after other includes.\n  Of course, keep your system-specific code small and localized.\n  Example:\n\n    #include \"foo/public/fooserver.h\"\n\n    #include \"base/port.h\"  // For LANG_CXX11.\n\n    #ifdef LANG_CXX11\n    #include \u003cinitializer_list\u003e\n    #endif  // LANG_CXX11\n\n\u003cstdio.h\u003e is not a conditional include, so it should be at the normal recommended location.",
