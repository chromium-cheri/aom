      "message": "Jerome: I just realized that we should increment AOM_ENCODER_ABI_VERSION on the master branch and then merge the change to the braeburn branch. Could you move this change to a separate CL for the master branch? Thanks.\n\nThe reason is that these AOM_xxx_ABI_VERSION macros must be incremented linearly (i.e., they cannot be branched). A good way to ensure that is to only increment them on the master branch.",
