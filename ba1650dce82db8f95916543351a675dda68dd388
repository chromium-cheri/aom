One risk, however, for webrtc would be that if a tool were reenabled they\u0027d need to do e.g., chrome or other version checks.\n\nThere\u0027s likely room for additional checks like this given what\u0027s disabled. Jerome I know you added some, it might be worth making a pass through the code with the current set of disabled tools.",
