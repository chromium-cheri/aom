      "message": "yeah, that\u0027s what\u0027s going on. The change from an error to just this message was accompanied by a check that GIT_EXECUTABLE actually exists before attempting to run git. In a snapshot we\u0027ll end up with the CHANGELOG version. In a snapshot w/o .git GIT_EXECUTABLE may exist, but since ERROR_QUIET is passed to the execute_process wrapping the \"git describe\" run everything will be fine (famous. last. words.).",
