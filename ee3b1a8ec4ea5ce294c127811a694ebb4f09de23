      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\n\nThis patch merges the code related to FPMT interface in encoder_encode() and multithread framework changes under CONFIG_FRAME_PARALLEL_ENCODE to the default path. This patch also enables the usage of the configuration parameter --fp-mt in the default path.\n\nWhile testing, it was observed that the unit test \u0027RcInterfaceTest\u0027 runs for 250 frames resulting in \u0027cpi-\u003egf_frame_index\u0027 to reach MAX_STATIC_GF_GROUP_LENGTH and thereby causing an out of bounds exception while accessing gf_group elements in encoder_encode(). In the parent version, this was handled because of the early termination in av1_encode_strategy() before any gf_group element was being accessed. Hence to handle this case now, this patch also adds the code to reset \u0027cpi-\u003egf_frame_index\u0027 in encoder_encode() when it reaches the maximum limit of MAX_STATIC_GF_GROUP_LENGTH.\n\nThis patch is bit-exact and has been locally verified with bitstream match tests in both the default and FPMT path. We have also validated this patch with address, thread, undefined and integer sanitizers.\n\nPlease review.\n\nRegards,\nRemya",
