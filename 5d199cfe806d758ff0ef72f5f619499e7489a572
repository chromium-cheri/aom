      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\n\nIn this patch we have increased the aggressiveness of the speed feature \u0027prune_inter_modes_based_on_tpl\u0027. \n\nIn the patch (https://aomedia-review.googlesource.com/c/aom/+/116045) the speed feature was changed to take only three values (0, 1, 3 and 2 was unused). Thus, we have cleaned-up the code in that direction i.e., the sf takes the value of 2 for speed 4 and 5 and value of 3 for speed 6. \n\nThe change is bit-exact for speed 5 and below. \n\n                      Instruction Count       BD-Rate Loss(%)\ncpu-used  Resolution   Reduction(%)     avg.psnr  ovr.psnr    ssim  \n   6       LOW RES       1.995           0.2360    0.2392    0.2210 \n   6       MID RES       2.217           0.2179    0.2375    0.1768\n   6        HD RES       2.226           0.2751    0.2829    0.2736\n   6       Average       2.108           0.2426    0.2520    0.2241\n\nIn the commit message, Quality Loss column:\n[+] sign is for BD-Rate drop\n[-] sign is for BD-Rate improvement\nThe instruction count reduction specified has been measured using command:\n$ perf stat -e instructions:u ./aomenc â€¦\n \nPlease review the patch.\nThank you.",
