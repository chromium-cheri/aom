      "message": "In general I\u0027m fine with this, but the default install prefix on Windows leads to an always broken install target w/o administrator privileges. That\u0027s the main reason for the exclusion-- I\u0027m not sure that the addition of an install target actually provides any additional value to MSVC users, but as long as ALL_BUILD isn\u0027t broken by this adding the target to MSVC is harmless.\n",

      "message": "ALL_BUILD is indeed not broken and using default values, `cmake --build builddir -t install` does indeed need admin privileges, but for people who are trying to integrate aom into their own project, they are usually installing into places that they have permissions to, so this would at least make it so they don\u0027t have to manually mv all of the files and can just point CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX or DESTDIR to their own location.",
