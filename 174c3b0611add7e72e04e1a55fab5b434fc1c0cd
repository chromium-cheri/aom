      "message": "In the case that we reach the maximum iteration without convergence, we might not have the correct data stored in centroids/indices.\n\nHere\u0027s a toy example:\nIf max_itr \u003d 1, we only enter the loop once. We have prev_l \u003d 0, and l \u003d 1. So the update is written to centroids_tmp/indices_tmp. If this_dist \u003c\u003d pre_dist, then nothing gets written to centroids/indices.\n\nIt general, this seems to be an issue whenever max_itr is odd.",
