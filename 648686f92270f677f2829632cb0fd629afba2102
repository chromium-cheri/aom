      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\n\nThis CL addresses the issue of NEON Unit tests failing for AV1ConvolveXTest. The\nMULTITAP_SHARP2 case was not handled properly in the av1_convolve_x_sr_neon\nand av1_convolve_y_sr_neon, leading to the 8-Tap intrinsic being called for 12-tap \ncase. We have fixed the issue by calling the c-function for filter_taps \u003e 8 in the NEON\nfunctions. The change has been verified at encoder as well as test-bench level.\n\nKindly review the patch.\n\nRegards,\nVishesh",
