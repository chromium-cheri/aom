      "message": "Quite possibly, I have not tested to see what impact removing the bias from PAVG has to the 4-point Type-VII.\n\nWe added the PAVG operation in the Type-VII DST to reduce some intermediate values so the 2-D transforms using it would still fit in 16-bits.  If rect_tx_ext is ever enabled (1:4 and 4:1 transforms), we will need to revisit this to make sure the Type-VII still fits in 16-bits.",
