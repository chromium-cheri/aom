      "message": "Hi James and Yunqing,\n\nPlease review the AVX2 intrinsic optimization of 8x8 variance for a 16x16 block.\n\nPlease check the encoder speed up results measured using timer and instruction count based as below. Please note timer based results are based on a limited set of test contents and instruction count is measured using Borg test.\n\nBased on Timer:\n       Encode Time\ncpu    Reduction(%)\n 7       0.125\n 8       0.459\n 9       0.591\n10       0.658\n\nBased on Instruction Count:\n     Instruction Count\ncpu    Reduction(%)\n 7       0.495\n 8       0.697\n 9       1.041\n10       1.140\n\nIn the commit/review message:\n[-] sign indicates encode time/instruction count increase\n[+] sign indicates encode time/instruction count reduction\nThe instruction count reduction specified has been measured using command:\n$ perf stat -e instructions:u ./aomenc\n\nThe Speed up observed in other speed levels are negligible. Please review the patch.\n\nThanks \u0026 Regards,\nVenkata.",
