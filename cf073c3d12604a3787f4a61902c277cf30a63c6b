      "message": "According to the tests that fail, the psnr value is less than the threshold value. Digging into how this psnr value is calculated I found that it is calculated in aom_calc_highbd_psnr[1]. This calls highbd_get_sse where aom_highbd_8_mse16x16[2] function is called to calculate value of sse. Is this function should be called even when the case for bit depth value is 10 or 12? \n\n[1]https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:third_party/libaom/source/libaom/aom_dsp/psnr.c;drc\u003d5861e434c539370b8a7ff237770e01611de45cc8;l\u003d341\n[2] https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:third_party/libaom/source/libaom/aom_dsp/psnr.c;drc\u003d5861e434c539370b8a7ff237770e01611de45cc8;l\u003d145",
