      "message": "Hi Remya,\n\nOne of our tests, which compares the encoded AVIF file with a previously encoded \"golden\" AVIF file, fails after this commit. The test should be rewritten to calculate a distortion metric such as PSNR with the source input image, rather than requiring the encoded AVIF remain stable.\n\nWhile investigating the test failure, I studied this CL. If I understand it correctly, the effect of this CL is that we are pruning less often. So I would expect the instruction count to increase and the quality to improve. But the commit message says there is an instruction count reduction, and the BD-rate loss is positive for PSNR. Do you know why?\n\nThanks,\nWan-Teh",
