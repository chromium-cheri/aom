      "message": "This CL fixes the memory leaks due to the thread-specific `mv_costs` and `dv_costs` allocated in `prepare_enc_workers()` in case of an early termination by adding the aom_free() calls for the same in `free_thread_data()`.\n \nDirectly invoking aom_free() on thread-specific `mv_costs` and `dv_costs` in `free_thread_data()` can result in double free error for some cases. For e.g., freeing `thread_data-\u003etd-\u003emb.mv_costs` after first pass encode as it points to the same address as `cpi-\u003etd.mb.mv_costs` which would have already been freed in `dealloc_compressor_data()`. Hence, the allocation and freeing of `x-\u003emv_costs` and `x-\u003edv_costs` are done using newly introduced `mv_costs_base_ptr` and `dv_costs_base_ptr` respectively in ThreadData structure. `x-\u003emv_costs` and `x-\u003edv_costs` are initialized appropriately using these base pointers.\n\nThis change is bit-exact and has been verified using bitstream-match tests for a combination of various configuration values for --threads, --tile-rows, --tile-columns, --cpu-used, --end-usage, --row-mt, --fp-mt, etc. Validated all unit-tests with sanitizers (address and thread) and valgrind.",
