      "message": "It is confusing as to why there are two loops here that do nearly the same thing.  After reading this code for a while, I realized it was because subsequent calls to od_dering (for the other color planes (pli !\u003d 0) assume that dir[][] has been computed through a side effect of the first call!\n\nThis has a serious consequence that in the encoder search, looking for the optimal deringing threshold actually calls the directional search, od_dir_find8(), over and over again for each level.\n\nPlease separate these concerns and require that calls to od_dering() have a fully initialized dir[][] array.  It will you to simplify this code, and the encoder search will be much faster.",
