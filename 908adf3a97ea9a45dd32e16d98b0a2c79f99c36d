      "message": "Hi Yunqing, \n\nIn this patch, we have added the AVX2 variant for the function av1_calc_proj_params_high_bd_c(). The change provides 0.387% and 0.558% encode time reduction for speed 3 and 4 respectively with some negligible gains for lower speed presets. We have also added test-bench support for the same.\n\nThe encode time data is generated on Intel(R) i7-6700 machine with gcc-7.5. Bit-exactness has been verified locally for both the LBD as well as the HBD paths.\n\nKindly review the CL.\n\nRegards,\nVishesh\n",
