      "message": "Unfortunately I didn\u0027t know about this CL when I cherry-picked f19edfa95f8dc9fa596282a210757e4d6d0cd490 to the celestia branch for the libaom v3.1.2 release. Let\u0027s cherry-pick this CL to the celestia branch so that this will be in libaom v3.1.3 if we ever make that release.\n\nChristopher: Is there any other CL related to this one that we should also cherry-pick?",
