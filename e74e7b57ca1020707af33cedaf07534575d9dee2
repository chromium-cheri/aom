      "message": "Second commit to consolidate SDP and ERP.\n\nThis is the second commit that adds the out-of-flag data structures for ERP.\nIn particular, this one adds the partition_tree data structure to tracks the partitioning on the decoder side.\nThere are several optimizations in progress with SDP:\n1. Currently the two separate trees are stored for luma and chroma. There are some room for memory reduction here.\n2. Eventually get_partition functions should be fully replaced by ptree-\u003epartition. This is not done in this commit to make the changes relatively small.\n",
