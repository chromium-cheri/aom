      "message": "If CONFIG_THREE_PASS_IVF is set to 0 then when encoding the third pass the encoder will emit an error message stating that CONFIG_THREE_PASS_IVF is needed to read the bitstream. \nI did not include the whole three-pass encoding stuff with the flag because it is very possible that this is going to be an on-going effort that could take quite a while. As some codes are \"tangled\" with two pass encoding, it would make it harder to maintain with upstream changes that may not care too much about what is in a disabled config flag. \nSo in the end I included everything related to ivf parsing with the flag, and in the future if we want to go with the path to include them into the main library, we can just remove the flags, or if we have better alternatives we just need to change these parts. Meanwhile, all other efforts that uses this three-pass encoding \"framework\" do not need to worry too much about the config flag and such.",
