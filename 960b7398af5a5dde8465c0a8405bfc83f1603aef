It looks like the Y pyramid is being computed properly, but then invalidated by some other thread while we\u0027re still using it.\n\nPlease can we hold off on merging this for a couple of hours while I finish investigating? If I can\u0027t figure it out by then, then I\u0027m happy for this revert to go through",

Currently I\u0027m running the lowres2 test set, to make sure that this fix doesn\u0027t change the encoder results in any other cases. If that goes through successfully (which will take an hour or two), then we can merge my fix.",
