      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\nThis patch moves error from AV1_COMP to AV1_PRIMARY and AV1Decoder. This adds error handling in av1_create_primary_compressor. This change also facilitates future CLs where initialization of seq_params is split from frame level initializations.\n\nCurrently, cpi and cpi_lap had their separate error because of the structural design. So, error.setjmp needed to be set and reset for them separately in encoder_encode. With this patch, since error is moved to primary context, all the cpi\u0027s can refer to the same error variable and only 1 error.setjmp needs to be set/reset.\n\nThis change is bit-exact and has been locally verified with bitstream match tests over a combination of various configuration values for --threads, --tile-rows, --tile-columns, --cpu-used, --end-usage,  --row-mt, etc. Decoder conformance is verified using --test-decode\u003dfatal and sanitizer tests.\n\nPlease review.",
