      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\n\nThis patch releases the previously used frame buffer by a frame_parallel_level 1 frame during av1_init_parallel_frame_context(), before launching the parallel frame encodes. In the parent version, the release of the previously used frame buffer by a frame_parallel_level 1 frame was happening within its av1_get_compressed_data() call which can cause a potential data race when the same frame buffer is simultaneously accessed by a frame_parallel_level 2 frame during its parallel encode. This patch fixes the above mentioned scenario.\n\nThis change is bit-exact and has been locally verified with bitstream match tests over a combination of various configuration values for --threads, --tile-rows, --tile-columns, --cpu-used, --end-usage, --row-mt, etc.\n\nPlease review.\n\nRegards,\nRemya",
