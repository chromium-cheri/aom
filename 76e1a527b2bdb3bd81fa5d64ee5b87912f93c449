      "message": "Hey Marco, I am trying to work on the reference frame syntax and I wanted to make a change that assumes a frame will only update 0 or 1 reference slot (unless it is a key frame.) This part of svc seems to violate that but I don\u0027t see any reason why you would want to refresh both last and golden. Let me know if this change is ok with you, and what configurations I would need to test to make sure it didn\u0027t break svc. ",

      "message": "Hi Sarah,\n\nThere are cases for RTC where one would want to update more than one reference on a given frame. For example, for sync frames on the base layer, which are used by application to indicate enhancement layers are safe to decode again (after packet loss). So i think its better to keep that option.\n\nFor testing: the unit tests for real-time mode should offer good coverage, if needed we can also run some additional manual tests with the aomenc \nand examples/svc_encoder_rtc command lines.",
