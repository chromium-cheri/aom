      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\nThis patch correctly handles the error propagation from enoder_encode() across parallel frames. Previously, there was a single instance of error (single longjmp) across the parallel frames corresponding to ppi, which could result in undefined behavior if any parallel_cpi (except first cpi which always runs from master thread) gives rises to an internal error.\n\nIn this patch, a jump point is added for an error in any of the parallel frames to return to the beginning of av1_get_compressed_data(), thereby propagating it to ppi.\n\nThe change is verified by inducing error for a frame with frame_parallel_level\u003d2 inside encode_frame_to_data_rate(). Segmentation fault (core dumped) was observed without this change, while clean exit was observed with this change.\n\nThis change is bit-exact and has been locally verified with bitstream match tests over a combination of various configuration values for --threads, --tile-rows,     --tile-columns, --cpu-used, --end-usage, --row-mt, etc. \n\nPlease review.\n",
