      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\n\nAs a continuation of the patch submitted by Fyodor (https://aomedia-review.googlesource.com/c/aom/+/127762), we have changed the scheduling order of workers in loop filter and loop restoration multi-threading in this patch. Also, worker 0 is changed to be the main thread in decoder.\n\nWe have verified that bit-stream generated is bit-exact with the parent commit. \n\nThe encode time reduction observed for rt preset with threads 4, tile cols 4, row-mt 1 (averaged over 360p, 480p, 720p, 1080p) is as follows:\n                Encode time\n cpu-used       Reduction (%)\n     6             0.45             \n     7             1.27\n     8             1.69\n     9             1.77\n\nThe encode time reduction observed for rt preset with threads 2, tile cols 2, row-mt 0 (averaged over 360p, 480p, 720p, 1080p) is as follows:\n\n                Encode time\n cpu-used       Reduction (%)\n     6              1.34             \n     7              4.83\n     8              6.57\n     9              7.19\n\nWe have also verified that the decoder output is bit-exact with the parent with no impact on the decode time.  \n\nPlease review.
