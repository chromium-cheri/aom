      "message": "Note that:\n- There are a number of functions related to this one named \"*build_*inter_predictor*\" in reconinter.[hc] and reconinter_enc.[hc]. So I think it\u0027s better to keep them where they are.\n- Even before, we were calling \"av1_init_inter_params\" and \"av1_make_inter_predictor\" (and including \"reconinter.h\"). They also have AV1 prefix and are declared in reconinter.h. It\u0027s just that we are now calling a higher level wrapper directly now.\n\nIn general, this file (variance.c) and other files changed in this patch are all encoder-only (as can be verified from aom_dsp/aom_dsp.cmake).",
