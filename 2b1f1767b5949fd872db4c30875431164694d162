      "message": "That\u0027s a good question, and I did consider both options indeed.\nHowever,\n- If we keep the old \"cq_level\" parameter, we will have to keep the existing tables for converting back and forth between two ranges still, so will lose the opportunity to clean up that part of the code.\n- Also, as we are working on AV2 here, I think it should be fine to break backward compatibility. (Note that \u0027master\u0027 branch, which is for AV1, will NOT have this change).\nThat\u0027s why I intentionally changed the name to \"--qp\", so users don\u0027t provide the q index in the wrong range by mistake.",
