      "message": "Debargha,\nThis patch reduces the incorrectness in allocating bits to keyframes in case of single pass VBR with a high kf-max-dist. We have done this by limiting the interval of frames that the keyframe can steal bits from. \n\nWe have experimented with multiple values of intervals(10s, 5s and 3s) using BORG tests and found that 5s was the optimal value.\n\nPlease review.",
