      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\n\nThis patch extends the disabling of extended partitions at low quantizers to speed 2. \nFor speed 2, the qindex threshold used for disabling extended partitions is 50 for screen contents, and 70 and 80 respectively for lowres and midres/hdres for non-screen contents.\nAlso, the code corresponding to the setting of ext_partition_eval_thresh speed feature in av1_set_speed_features_qindex_dependent() is refactored to avoid code duplication.\n\nPlease find the detailed borg results for speed 2 below.\n\n         |            | Instruction Count |        BD-Rate Loss(%)       |\ncpu-used | Resolution |    Reduction(%)   | avg.psnr  ovr.psnr   ssim    |\n-------- | ---------- | ----------------- | --------  --------  -------- |\n   2     |  LOW RES   |       2.835       |  0.0687    0.0677    0.0481  |\n   2     |  MID RES   |       1.571       |  0.0342    0.0375    0.0166  |\n   2     |   HD RES*  |       2.417       |  0.0599    0.0546    0.0336  |\n   2     |  Average   |       2.421       |  0.0559    0.0549    0.0344  |\n   \n   *60 frame run\n    \nIn the commit message, BD rate impact column:\n[+] sign is for BD-Rate drop\n[-] sign is for BD-Rate improvement\nThe instruction count reduction specified has been measured using command:\n$ perf stat -e instructions:u ./aomenc â€¦\n\nFor other speed levels, this is a bit-exact change with no speed impact (verified locally on a few test cases).\n\nPlease review the patch.\n\nThanks,\nNithya",
