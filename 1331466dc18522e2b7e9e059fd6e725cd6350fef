      "message": "though it matches libvpx my only concern with using the name here is we have the (even more confusing) CONFIG_LOWBITDEPTH flag, so you could have CONFIG_LOWBITDEPTH\u003d0 CONFIG_AV1_HIGHBITDEPTH\u003d1 or CONFIG_LOWBITDEPTH\u003d0 CONFIG_AV1_HIGHBITDEPTH\u003d0 for instance. we could make this CONFIG_MAX_BITDEPTH or similar, but that still wouldn\u0027t let us remove the highbd functions if we wanted to be faithful to the intent of CONFIG_LOWBITDEPTH.\n\nat the very least we should document that setting CONFIG_AV1_HIGHBITDEPTH\u003d0 overrides CONFIG_LOWBITDEPTH",
