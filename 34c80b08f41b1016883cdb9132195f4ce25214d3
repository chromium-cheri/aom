      "message": "The `\u003c\u003d` is only asserting the index is within array bounds. We could use `\u003d\u003d` instead to assert a stronger property -- the code that allocates the `lr_sync-\u003elrworkerdata` array and the code here have the same view of what the array size should be. Since I don\u0027t fully understand this code, I am not sure if that property needs to hold.",
