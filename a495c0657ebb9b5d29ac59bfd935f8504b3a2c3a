      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\n\nWe have noticed a nightly build failure in valgrind unit-tests due to recent changes in avg_test.cc file.\nhttps://build.aomedia.org/jenkins/job/libaom__unit_tests-valgrind/1942/\n\nSeveral builds were failing due to the recent changes incorporated by us in this file for intrinsic optimization of average_8x8 function. We have identified that the build failure was due to uninitialized variables present in the unit-test. In this patch the variables are initialized properly to avoid these errors.\n\nPlease review the patch.\n\nThanks \u0026 Regards,\nVenkata.\n",
