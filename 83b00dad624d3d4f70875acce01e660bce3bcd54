      "message": "calloc() is often implemented as malloc() followed by a memset() call to zero the memory block. So this change can avoid zeroing OBU_BUFFER_SIZE (500 * 1024) bytes.",

      "message": "I know. I wanted memset() memory when I wrote the code initially. \n\nIt\u0027s harmless with uninitialized memory since we only operate on what we know to have read, but the intent of the original call was for a malloc+memset. calloc() docs state as much. \n\n$ man calloc\n\n... snip ...\n\n     The calloc() function contiguously allocates enough space for count objects that are size bytes of memory each and returns a pointer\n     to the allocated memory.  The allocated memory is filled with bytes of value zero.",
