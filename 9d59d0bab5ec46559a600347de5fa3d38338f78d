      "message": "Do we really need this? I\u0027d prefer to export the algo symbol.\n\n\u003e Fortunately, adding this symbol with the leading underscore to the exported symbols works fine, but I don\u0027t like this approach. I would very much prefer to use the corresponding aom_codec_av1_cx() and aom_codec_av1_dx() functions instead. Thoughts?\n\nWhile I don\u0027t have strong feelings either way, changing this to appease MSVC when we can just export the symbol explicitly seems like the wrong thing to do.",
