      "message": "I initially wanted to add this file to be similar as the output bitstream file in the config structure. the problem is that there is no interface to pass this file name into the \"encoder\" itself so encoder can access and write into this file. also, there is no interface to get the reconstructed frame out of the \"encoder\" so aomenc.c can write that into this file. so eventually I ended up using  a global variable to pass the file name into the underline encoder itself to avoid big interface changes. Do you have any suggestions on how I can work around this limitation on Linux?",
