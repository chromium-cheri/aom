      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\n\nWe had added the variable error_info to MACROBLOCK structure to\nmake it thread safe in a recent refactoring patch. This variable was\nbeing used in header related functions. Since these functions were \nmoved out of the scope of multi-threading, we are now removing the \nvariable from the structure, and accessing it through AV1_COMMON\ninstead.\n\nThe change has been verified to be bit-exact locally with no impact \non speed.\n\nKindly review the patch.\n\nRegards,\nVishesh",
