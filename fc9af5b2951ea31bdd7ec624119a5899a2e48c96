      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\n\nIn this patch, we have avoided code related to compound mode as only single reference prediction is used in real time speed 5 and 6. Also, as reduced number of references are used in real time, code corresponding to pruning of reference frames based on selective_ref_frame speed feature is avoided.\nThe results are as below:\n\n     Instruction Count\ncpu    Reduction(%)\n 5       1.143\n 6       1.271\n\nWe have tested the patch for good and rt presets and ensured bit-exact output.\n\nPlease review.\n\nThank you",
