      "message": "This is a good fix! frame_header_received should not be a local variable. The sequence header OBU has a similar issue; we should not use a local variable (seq_header_received, declared at line 546) for that. (We may be able to just use pbi-\u003esequence_header_ready). I am planning to fix it as part of aomedia:1875.",
