I misunderstood the last two lines of the comment because it is not clear which multiplication it is referring to.\n\nI thought it was referring to the multiplication in the next line:\n\n  diff *\u003d qmatrix[coeff_idx];\n\nBut it is actually referring to the multiplication `diff * diff` in line 62.\n\nI think we can disambiguate by changing the last line to:\n\n // multiplication diff * diff then does not risk overflowing.",
