      "message": "I do not think a non-trivial match is possible. From 178@hash_motion.c, when calculating hash values, only blocks fully inside picture are processed. In this case, hash value of current block is a random value which depends on how the out-of-boundary pixel are filled. There is no way to match any block in the established table. If there is a match, it is a false match (collision).\nRely on line 2611 is risky, since we may change the definition of valid prediction area later(larger for better compression, or smaller to please HW guys).",
