      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\n\nIn patch set 3, we have made the changes to set \u0027fp-mt\u0027 OFF by default, as you have suggested.\n\nSince FPMT is now off by default, to turn on FPMT, we need to wait till the command line arguments are available, which is after encoder_init(). Hence this patch also has changes to move the creation of parallel cpis from the time of encoder_init() (at which point fp-mt will always be OFF) to ctrl_set_fp_mt() where fp-mt is set via control call. The patch has also been tested with address sanitizer.\n\nPlease review.\n\nRegards,\nRemya \n",
