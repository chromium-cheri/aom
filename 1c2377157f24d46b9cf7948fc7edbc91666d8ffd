      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\n\nIn this patch, we have tried loop filtering 16 pixels at once if the minimum block dimension in a row/col of a superblock is greater than or equal to 16. By doing so, some of the redundant calls to set up loop filter parameters is avoided. \n\nThe results are as follows:\n\n     Instruction Count\ncpu     Reduction(%)\n 7       0.292\n 8       0.369\n 9       0.675\n 10      0.748\n \nThe instruction count reduction specified has been measured using command\n $ perf stat -e instructions:u ./aomenc â€¦\n\nPlease review. \n\nThank you.",
