      "message": "The simplest way to fix the signed-unsigned comparison warning is to add a \u0027u\u0027 or \u0027U\u0027 suffix to the constant, i.e., 0u or 0U.\n\nIf we need to cast 0 to size_t, in C++ we are supposed to write static_cast\u003csize_t\u003e(0). In latest versions of C++ we can also write size_t{0}. I am not sure if that is supported in C++11 (which libaom uses).",
