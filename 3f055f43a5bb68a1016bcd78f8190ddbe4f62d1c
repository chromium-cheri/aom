      "message": "I\u0027m also working on the other convolve functions, which include the av1_highbd_dist_wtd_convolve_* functions. The non-highbd arm versions are included in the jnt_convolve.c file and I was planning to follow the same scheme so the helper functions would go in the highbd_convolve.h header. If they should be included in the same single file then indeed I should just get them in the same .c file. What is the preferred way?",
