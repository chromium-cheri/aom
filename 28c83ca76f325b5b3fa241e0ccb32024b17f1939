      "message": "Yes. Until we are confident we have fixed all the integer overflows caused by large frame sizes, we should require `CONFIG_SIZE_LIMIT` be set to 1 in both 32-bit and 64-bit builds. In addition, `DECODE_WIDTH_LIMIT` and `DECODE_HEIGHT_LIMIT` probably need to be set to smaller values for 32-bit builds. For a reference, dav1d uses 8192 in 32-bit builds.\n\nI believe we can also fix these integer overflows by casting to the `unsigned int` type, which would work for 32-bit builds. I can upload such a CL for comparison. Casting to `unsigned int` requires verifying that the pointer diff is not negative.",
