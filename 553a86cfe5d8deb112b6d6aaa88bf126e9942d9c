      "message": "The function `av1_alloc_pc_tree_node()` handles the allocation of `PC_TREE` node. In the parent version, the caller sites of this function didn\u0027t check the allocation status. In this CL, the return status of `av1_alloc_pc_tree_node()` is verified at all call sites, and `aom_internal_error()` is invoked with the appropriate error information in case of an allocation failure.\n\nWe have validated this CL by introducing allocation failure at all instances of `av1_alloc_pc_tree_node()` and ensuring that the encoder exits gracefully. The allocation sites under `CONFIG_PARTITION_SEARCH_ORDER` are tested through the unit-test `ExternalPartitionTestAPI`.\n\nThis change is bit-exact and has been verified using bitstream-match tests for a combination of various configuration values for --threads, --tile-rows, --tile-columns, --cpu-used, --end-usage, --row-mt, --fp-mt, etc. Validated all unit-tests with sanitizers (address and thread) and valgrind.",
