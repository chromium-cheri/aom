      "message": "We disabled obmc and warped motion in comp ref inter blocks to meet requirements from the hw side.\nThe change here will enable comp ref + obmc. So I would recommend this patch only include motion refinement for single-ref+warped_motion, but not enabling warped_motion + comp ref (which can be implemented in a separate patch without turning on comp_ref+obmc, using a macro to turn this feature on/off but by default off, later we can propose the change to aom group).\nAlso it would be good if the performance gain from each individual change can be added to the commit msgs.",
