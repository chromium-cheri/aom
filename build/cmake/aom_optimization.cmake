# Adds an object library target. Terminates generation if $flag is not supported
# by the current compiler. $flag is the intrinsics flag required by the current
# compiler, and is added to the compile flags for all sources in $sources.

# dependent upon the created target.
#
# Note: the libaom target is always updated because OBJECT libraries have rules
# that disallow the direct addition of .o files to them as dependencies. Static
# libraries do not have this limitation.
