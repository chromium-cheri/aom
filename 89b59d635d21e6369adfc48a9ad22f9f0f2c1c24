      "message": "Hi Lester, Yunqing\n\nThis patch reuses aom_subtract_block() and aom_highbd_subtract_block() intrinsics for \nthe computation of subpel gradients for low-bd and high-bd functions respectively.\n\nIn order to use the intrinsic, allocations of x_grad and y_grad buffers are modified to 32-byte aligned. Also unit test of low-bd module is updated to support AVX2 intrinsic.\n\nFor this change, speed up is negligible for encoder and decoder. This change is bit-exact with reference and has been locally verified with bitstream match tests.\n\nPlease review the patch.\nThank you.",
