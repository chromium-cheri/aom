      "message": "Note that compressed_frame_buf_ is 256 KB long. (kCodeBufferSize is defined as 256 * 1024 at line 23). Therefore, for some fuzz test cases, the invalid pointer will still point within the bounds of compressed_frame_buf_ and therefore won\u0027t be reported as a heap-buffer-overflow by ASAN.\n\nI have tested two possible solutions.\n\n1. For each frame, re-allocate compressed_frame_buf_ to be the exact size needed.\n\n2. Use ASAN manual memory poisoning.\n\nBoth solutions work. I chose the second solution in this CL because it seems more similar to production code.",
