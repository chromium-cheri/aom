      "message": "We should evaluate the risk of actually breaking a client of the libaom shared library. I think the risk is near zero because:\n\n1. This client needs to use these film grain functions.\n2. This client needs to include the private libaom headers that declare these film grain functions. (This violates the rules of using a library.)\n3. This client needs to use the libaom shared library and is unable to switch to the libaom static library.\n\nTherefore I think it is safe to fix the incorrect export of those film grain functions. This is much simpler than creating stubs or splitting the exports file.",
