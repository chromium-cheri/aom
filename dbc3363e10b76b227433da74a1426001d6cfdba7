Do we currently have a possibility to produce a scalable bitstream with AV1 encoder?\n\n- Does it work with the hidden frames that is not shown? If the LAST_FRAME is a \"never shown frame\", it does not have any film grain data.",

      "message": "Hi Andrey. I have uploaded a new patch which hopefully resolves the second issue. It now properly searches for the reference frame with the matching and present film grain parameters. I do not know about scalability support - I cannot see a command line argument. I think adding scalable film grain support to the encoder is outside of the scope of this patch.",
