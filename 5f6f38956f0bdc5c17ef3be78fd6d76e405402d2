      "message": "A local instance of `aom_internal_error_info` is used to add the setjmp target in `prepare_fpmt_workers()`, and `cm-\u003eerror` of each `parallel_cpi[frame_idx]` is made to point to the local `error` structure. This will facilitate the longjmp in case of an error in `av1_alloc_cdef_buffers()`.\n\nAlso, `restore_workers_after_fpmt()` is called inside the setjmp target to restore the worker states. Currently, `restore_workers_after_fpmt()` uses `p_mt_info-\u003enum_workers` to restore workers. In case of an early termination during worker preparation, `restore_workers_after_fpmt()` needs to restore the exact number of workers which were successfully prepared to avoid SEGV error. In order to facilitate this, a new variable `num_fpmt_workers_prepared` is added to `ppi-\u003ep_mt_info` and the same is used to restore the workers.\n\nThis change is bit-exact and has been verified using bitstream-match tests for a combination of various configuration values for --threads, --tile-rows, --tile-columns, --cpu-used, --end-usage, --row-mt, --fp-mt, etc. Validated all unit-tests with sanitizers (address and thread) and valgrind.",
