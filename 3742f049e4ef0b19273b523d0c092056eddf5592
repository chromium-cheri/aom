      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\n\nThe sf ‘early_term_chroma_palette_size_search’ was first introduced in https://aomedia-review.googlesource.com/c/aom/+/140222. As per the statistics, around 80% of times header cost increases with increase in palette size. Hence, this sf was introduced to reduce the rd-evaluations of Palette mode (Chroma) through early termination based on header cost. This CL extends this sf to all speed levels of ‘rt’ preset.\n\nFor this patch, no impact seen for --tune-content\u003ddefault as Palette mode is not enabled.\n\nPlease check the borg results for rtc-screen testset (--tune-content\u003dscreen):\n\n```\n               Instruction Count        BD-Rate Loss(%)\n    cpu-used     Reduction(%)     avg.psnr   ovr.psnr   ssim\n        7          0.349          0.0000     0.0000     0.0000\n        8          0.373          0.0000     0.0000     0.0000\n        9          0.745          0.0000     0.0000     0.0000\n        10         0.765          0.0000     0.0000     0.0000\n```\n\nThe instruction count reduction specified has been measured using command:\n $ perf stat -e instructions:u ./aomenc …\n\nFor rtc-screen testset, we have observed bit-exact output for this change. However, we mentioned STATS_CHANGED in the commit message since encoder output may change based on content property.\n\nPlease review the patch.\n\nThanks \u0026 Regards,\nVenkata.\n",
