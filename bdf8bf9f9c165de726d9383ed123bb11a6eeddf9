The error message is:\n\nCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:251 (add_dependencies):\n  Cannot add target-level dependencies to non-existent target\n  \"aom_encoder_stats\".\n\n  The add_dependencies works for top-level logical targets created by the\n  add_executable, add_library, or add_custom_target commands.  If you want to\n  add file-level dependencies see the DEPENDS option of the add_custom_target\n  and add_custom_command commands.\n\nI wrote a fix in https://aomedia-review.googlesource.com/c/aom/+/71141.",
