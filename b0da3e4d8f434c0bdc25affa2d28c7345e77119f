      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\nThis patch abstracts use_svc flag from AV1_COMP to AV1_PRIMARY. use_svc is abstracted to primary structure because it gets set in ctrl_set_svc_params and stays constant for all the frames after that. This also facilitates the future CLs where initializations of seq_params is split from the initializations of cpi.\n\nThis change is bit-exact and has been locally verified with bitstream match tests over a combination of various configuration values for --threads, --tile-rows, --tile-columns, --cpu-used, --end-usage,  --row-mt, etc. \n\nPlease review.",
