      "message": "Mild preference to keep it as x2,x3,x4 order since the #if condition is mostly an implementation detail?\n\nIf the #if condition for when to introduce these becomes too complicated we could alternatively just introduce new names for these helpers to avoid the name clash, and avoid using the x2,x3,x4 intrinsics and associated #if conditions entirely. As far as I\u0027m aware these intrinsics don\u0027t actually do anything special in modern compilers beyond what our existing implementation here does?",
