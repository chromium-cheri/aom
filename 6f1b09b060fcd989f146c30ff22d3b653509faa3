      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\n\nWe benchmarked the subpel_search_method speed feature and observed that\nspeed quality trade-off is poor with SUBPEL_TREE_PRUNED_MORE. In order to \nimprove the trade-off, we submitted the patch to set subpel_search_method as \nSUBPEL_TREE_PRUNED for speed 5, 6.\n\nPlease find the detailed borg result below.\n\n CPU   Test Set   Instruction Count    BD-Rate Loss %\n                    Reduction %   avg.psnr ovr.psnr   ssim\n  5        rtc        -0.024      -0.0000  -0.0000  -0.0000\n  5   rtc_derf        -0.032      -0.0000  -0.0000  -0.0000\n  5    Average        -0.028      -0.0000  -0.0000  -0.0000\n  \n  6        rtc        -1.400      -0.3741  -0.3799  -0.3114\n  6   rtc_derf        -1.628      -0.5247  -0.5540  -0.4880\n  6    Average        -1.511      -0.4368  -0.4525  -0.3850\n \nIn the commit message, BD rate impact column:\n[+] sign is for BD-Rate drop \n[-] sign is for BD-Rate improvement. \nThe instruction count reduction specified has been measured using command: \n$ perf stat -e instructions:u ./aomenc â€¦ \n\nThe results are generated with respect to https://aomedia-review.googlesource.com/c/aom/+/149481\nas baseline.\n\nThere is no bitstream impact in speed 5 as the speed feature use_fullpel_costlist\nis not set.\n\nPlease review the patch. \n\nThank you.",
