If you\u0027re trying to match webrtc settings then doing it when !CONFIG_REALTIME_ONLY to make the two equivalent might make sense, but we\u0027d want to call that out.\n\nI think if realtime can be used with these settings then we\u0027d do better to pick up the defaults in all builds and maybe have a webrtc-like configuration for !CONFIG, unless I\u0027m misunderstanding things.",
