I was out of the office.\n\nI thought this CL was a good idea, so I brought up this issue at our team meeting on Thursday. After a lively discussion, we decided to uphold the \"WontFix\" resolution of bug aomedia:3126, for a smaller default value of kf_max_dist may potentially increase the file size for some use cases. Applications that have specific requirements for the key frame interval must set kf_max_dist explicitly.",
