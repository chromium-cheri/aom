      "message": "In sync_enc_workers(), the error status of master thread is not available, as winterface-\u003esync() is invoked only for worker threads. The error status of the master thread needs to be read to facilitate its error propagation. This CL fixes this issue by initializing \u0027had_error\u0027 with the error status of the master thread.\n\nThe sync of master thread in sync_enc_workers() earlier removed in this [CL](https://aomedia-review.googlesource.com/c/aom/+/140223) to facilitate FPMT. This is because, in case of FPMT the master threads of each parallel encode frame (level 1 workers) will be overloaded as slave threads (level 2 workers) when they reach MT stages in their respective frame encodes. As the state of the master thread would be set to \"WORK\" due to the ‘get_compressed_data_hook’ being run on it, sync must not be called on it before it exits the frame parallel encode. Otherwise it may result in deadlock.",
