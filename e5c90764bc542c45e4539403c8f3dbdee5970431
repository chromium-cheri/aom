      "message": "Yes, it will be hard to tell gain or loss, and we need to run more sequences. And I should use find_interp_filter_in_stats to find the matching interp_filters before compound search to improve the accuracy. Thanks for the suggestion.\n\nFor the speed, I think it depends on which way can hit find_interp_filter_in_stats more, and also the early termination (the one after interpolation_filter_search is very rare, and the one after compound_type_rd is quite often).",
