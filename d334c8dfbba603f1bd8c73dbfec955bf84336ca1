      "message": "Thank you for implementing this, it\u0027s good to have a test case for this.\n\nI\u0027m not sure random data is a good test case here, as then the two images won\u0027t have any meaningful matches for aom_compute_flow_at_point to find. Would it be possible to change the input setup so that it loads two frames from one of the test videos instead? I think Vertical_Bayshore_270x480_2997.y4m would be a good choice.",

      "message": "Oh, somehow that video ended up in my test data directory so I thought it was downloaded by `make testdata`. If not, please feel free to substitute one of the other videos which are already part of the test data.\n\nAs for the initial u and v values, they don\u0027t need to be super accurate, small random values are probably fine. It\u0027s mostly just about testing the algorithm on more realistic input data, as it needs some sort of structure to work with.",
