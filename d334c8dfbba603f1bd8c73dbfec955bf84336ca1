      "message": "Thank you for implementing this, it\u0027s good to have a test case for this.\n\nI\u0027m not sure random data is a good test case here, as then the two images won\u0027t have any meaningful matches for aom_compute_flow_at_point to find. Would it be possible to change the input setup so that it loads two frames from one of the test videos instead? I think Vertical_Bayshore_270x480_2997.y4m would be a good choice.",
