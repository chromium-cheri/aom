I checked out both the current HEAD and commit 8d5a4ba1422cc8835f5d0e81af397deb93c759a2, which was Urvang\u0027s last CL for bug aomedia:1875.\n\n2. I first commented out this block of code, which we believe was responsible for fixing those oss-fuzz bugs. Unfortunately, I could not reproduce any of the oss-fuzz bugs. This means the oss-fuzz bugs were also fixed by some other change.\n\n3. I then applied patchset 8 of this CL. I could not reproduce any of the oss-fuzz bugs.",
