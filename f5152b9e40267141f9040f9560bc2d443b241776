      "message": "this function is actually really weird now because after this change, it has nothing to do with frame sizes any more - it sets `use_highbitdepth` and `subsampling_x` and `subsampling_y`\n\nand it doesn\u0027t need to call `av1_set_speed_features_*` either.\n\nAlso I don\u0027t know why `init_ref_frame_bufs` is called in this function - it has nothing to do with frame width or bitdepth or subsampling......\n\n`init_motion_estimation` also has nothing to do with these, and we have a comment there for it to be removed.\n\nSo this is a good opportunity here to clean up. If the unrelated code ends up being removed, all it does is `av1_tf_info_alloc` which does rely on subsampling and bitdepth.",
