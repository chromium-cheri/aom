      "message": "Did you get the gains if you have no rounding between the horizontal and vertical passes?  For now, it may be a good idea to have this intermediate rounding (not burn the bridge right away), but I think intermediate rounding only should be done if it really is necessary, so that the horiz/vert order becomes irrelevant and a choice of the implementor.\n\nTo eliminate the intermediate rounding, all filter coefficients should be 7 bit [-64 - 63].  The smooth, standard and sharp filters are 7 bit, but there is a dual filter experiment and a 12 tap temporal filter complicating this.  I haven\u0027t figured out how this works.  Is there a conflict?",
