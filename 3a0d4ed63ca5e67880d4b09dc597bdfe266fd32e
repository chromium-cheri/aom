      "message": "I feel like we\u0027re working at cross purposes. I\u0027m working on making Dionysus allow two forward refs and one backwards as part of b/246607870. Is this supposed to solve the same problem? It\u0027s certainly a simpler solution, but it looks like a bit of a kludge. \nShould we make this for now, and see if it helps, and then revert it once my Dionysus change lands? Or should I just punt on my change?",
