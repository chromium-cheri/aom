      "message": "In the original code, the relative pts is 10 - 11 \u003d -1. When the relative pts and duration are added, the addition is done using the 64-bit `unsigned long` type, so we get an unsigned integer overflow. Unsigned integer overflow is defined behavior in C, but is not expected here. So I increased the initial pts to 12 to avoid the unsigned integer overflow.",
