      "message": "That makes sense.\nNowadays I don\u0027t think the instruction has a high overhead. I\u0027ve tested versions with and without the emms instruction, and I did not observe encoding speed difference.\nThe fact that it\u0027s only used for a single function likely helped as well.\n\nInterestingly, I also tried to migrate the MMX codes to SSE2 and ditch the emms, but the result is quite a bit slower.",
