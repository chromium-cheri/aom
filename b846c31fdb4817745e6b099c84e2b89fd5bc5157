I could add a note referencing 2s complement, but if we have sanitizers to cover this then the comment becomes moot. I\u0027m testing some version of the sanitizer now. I think there may be conversion warnings to deal with for `-fsanitizer\u003dinteger` first, so `undefined` might be easier to start with.\n\n\u003e So I would omit this comment (the first sentence).\n\nI added the detail to the commit message instead so if someone does some archaeology they\u0027ll have a reference.",
