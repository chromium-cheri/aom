      "message": "Nit/optional: I understand this comment (the first sentence) now after some research. I think most C programmers, including myself, don\u0027t understand why abs() is not strictly necessary here. So this comment is really intended for the few C experts (to prevent them from removing abs()), but it is confusing for others.\n\nSo I would omit this comment (the first sentence).",

It would be good to go back to that variable name, so that all avg*.c files use the same variable name.\n\nThis would require changing `mean * mean` to `mean_abs * mean_abs` in the comments (line 250 and line 256).",
