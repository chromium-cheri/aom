      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\nThis patch introduces a framework that allows creation of multiple frame contexts (cpi). The number of frame parallel (fp) contexts are controlled by the variable num_fp_contexts located in AV1_PRIMARY. Currently its value (and hence the number of cpi(s) created) are set to 1. This code is added under the config macro CONFIG_FRAME_PARALLEL_ENCODE which is turned OFF by default.\n\nWe have internally tested this patch by forcing creation of multiple cpi(s) and the tests mentioned below are run with the CONFIG_FRAME_PARALLEL_ENCODE macro set to 1 and num_fp_contexts set to 4.\n\nThis change is bit-exact and has been locally verified with bitstream match tests over a combination of various configuration values for --threads, --tile-rows, --tile-columns, --cpu-used, --end-usage, --row-mt, etc. \n\nPlease review.",
