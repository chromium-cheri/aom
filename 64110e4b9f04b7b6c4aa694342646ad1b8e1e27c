      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\nThere were instances in the codebase where the LAP context would expect the values in gf_group to be set to 0(as they would have been at init time). This assumption will break after we abstract gf_group into AV1_PRIMARY, thus making it common to all frame level contexts(including cpi_lap). To handle this, this patch includes checks at relevant places to ensure that gf_group is not used by the LAP context.\n\nThis change is bit-exact and has been locally verified with bitstream match tests over a combination of various configuration values for --threads, --tile-rows, --tile-columns, --cpu-used, --end-usage, --row-mt, etc. \n\nPlease review.",
