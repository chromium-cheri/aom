      "message": "Hi Chi-Yo, Jingning, Lin, Yunqing,\n\nIn this CL, the SSE2 implementations of aom_hadamard_16x16() and aom_hadamard_32x32() are modified to match the output with that of C and AVX2 implementations. This CL also enables relevant unit-tests. \n\nThe SSE2 implementation of aom_hadamard_16x16() was producing output as below for each row (each of A,B,C,D,..... are 32-bit wide)\n\u003c \u003cA B C D\u003e \u003cI J K L\u003e \u003cE F G H\u003e \u003cM N O P\u003e \u003e\nThe AVX2 implementation and C implementation (which was modified to match AVX2 implementation) produce output as \n\u003c \u003cA B C D\u003e \u003cE F G H\u003e \u003cI J K L\u003e \u003cM N O P\u003e \u003e\nIn this CL, the store related functions are modified to take care of above reordering. Similar changes are done to the aom_hadamard_32x32() function as well.\n\nWe also verified that CL produces bit-exact output for --good, speed\u003d6 encoding mode (with above SSE2 functions enabled in both parent and current versions) with instruction count increase of 0.008% (the increase could be due to pointer increment logic). \n\nPlease review the CL.\n\nRegards,\nRanjit",
