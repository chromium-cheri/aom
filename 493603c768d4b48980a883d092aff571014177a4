      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\n\nThis patch enables loop-filter pipeline after encode for rt speed 5 and 6. The results are as follows:\n```\ncpu  Resolution   Tiles  Threads Encode time reduction (%)\n 5   180p          2x1     2       0.0\n 5   360p          4x1     4       0.5\n 5   720p          4x1     4       0.9\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t   \n 6   180p          2x1     2       1.0\n 6   360p          4x1     4       0.8\n 6   720p          4x1     4       1.0\n ```\nThe encode time reduction for 180p at speed 5 is 0% because of the following : \n\n- Loop filter is ~1% of the total encode time.\n- Loop filtering of last 2 superblock rows (there are only 3 superblock rows in a frame) can start only after encoding of the whole frame is complete.\n\nThe encode time reduction for 1080p resolution is excluded from the above table, as speed 5, 6 is forced to use speed 7.\n\nPlease review. \n\nThanks",
