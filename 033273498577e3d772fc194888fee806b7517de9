      "message": "This change did not have an effect in the past and it is not consistent to have a slower/better sub-pel algorithm for speed\u003d8 than speed\u003d7. This was resulting in speed loss after fix. Hence this code is removed.\nThere is speed-up seen with this CL for resolutions smaller than 480p (for speed\u003d8) as the cost list mechanism was not used during sub-pel motion estimation in parent version (which is based on the calculation of use_cost_list in cond_cost_list() and cond_cost_list_const()). As the cost-list based logic is applied now, speed-up is seen.",
