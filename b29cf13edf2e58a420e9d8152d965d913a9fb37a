      "message": "estimate_yrd_for_sb() is used for deciding best compound type and interintra decision and is currently being called for inter only and chroma rd is not done for these cases. Hence there is no intra handling in the same at this point of time.\nPopulating rd stats data based on explicit skip decison is recommended after chroma decision is done. Hence populating the rd data in txfm_yrd() is not recommended as per our understanding.",
