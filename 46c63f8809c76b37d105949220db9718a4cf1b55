      "message": "Hello Yunqing, Marco,\n\nThe parent version is triggering an assert in av1_encode_mv() for a testcase: desktop2360p, 200 kbps for cpu 8. The assert catches if the mv difference (new - ref) is zero. \n\nIn the CL, a condition is added to check whether the NEWMV is same as NEARESTMV in search_new_mv() in the reduced-complexity ME path. For NEARMV, this is not needed since early-term of NEARMV would mean early-term of NEWMV as well. For the combined_motion_search() path, this is already taken care by a similar condition. For good presets, it is taken care by av1_check_newmv_joint_nonzero().\n\nThe details of worst-case drops are:\n```\ncpu      clip                  BD Rate Loss (%)          Instr.
