      "message": "Currently if any allocation fails in `av1_alloc_txb_buf()`, the unallocated buffers can hold the stale address from previous allocations which will result in double free error in `av1_free_txb_buf()` during `encoder_destroy()`. This CL fixes this issue by clearing the dangling pointers immediately after freeing in `av1_free_txb_buf()`.\n\nThis change is bit-exact and has been verified using bitstream-match tests for a combination of various configuration values for --threads, --tile-rows, --tile-columns, --cpu-used, --end-usage, --row-mt, --fp-mt, etc. Validated all unit-tests with sanitizers (address and thread) and valgrind.",
