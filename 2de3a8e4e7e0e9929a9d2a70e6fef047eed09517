      "message": "@jingning - While fixing this patch, I realized that I basically had to fix b/261325007 along the way. That bug is fixed by the change to av1_superres_post_encode() in the latest version of this patch.\n\nIn order to avoid entangling this patch too deeply with b/261325007 , this patch leaves global motion disabled when superres is used. Then I have pushed a follow-up patch to re-enable global motion afterwards:\nhttps://aomedia-review.googlesource.com/c/aom/+/168861\n\nBut I wanted to tag you here too as this patch contains the underlying fix.",
