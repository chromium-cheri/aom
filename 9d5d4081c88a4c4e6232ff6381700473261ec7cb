      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\n\nWe noticed that cdef_copy_rect8_8bit_to_16bit() has only sse4.1 intrinsic optimization for converting source from 8bit to 16bit. This CL introduces AVX2 intrinsic optimization to process 16 pixels at a time.\n\nPlease check the encoder speed up results measured using timer and instruction count based as below. Please note timer based results are based on a limited set of test contents and instruction count is measured using Borg test.\n\nBased on Timer:\n       Encode Time\ncpu    Reduction(%)\n 7       0.150\n 8       0.187\n 9       0.225\n10       0.258\n\nBased on Instruction Count:\n     Instruction Count\ncpu    Reduction(%)\n 7       0.226\n 8       0.317\n 9       0.441\n10       0.484\n\nIn the commit/review message:\n[-] sign indicates encode time/instruction count increase\n[+] sign indicates encode time/instruction count reduction\nThe instruction count reduction specified has been measured using command:\n$ perf stat -e instructions:u ./aomenc\n\nBit-match is verified for \u0027GOOD\u0027 encoding mode. We have also measured decoder time for ‘Chimera-AV1-8bit-1920x1080-6736kbps.ivf’ stream and observed decode time reduction of 0.54%.\n\nPlease review the patch.\n\nThanks \u0026 Regards,\nVenkata.",
