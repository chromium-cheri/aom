Thanks!\n\nHere\u0027s what I did:\n\nhttps://aomedia.googlesource.com/aom/+log/v2.0.0..v2.0.1\nhttps://aomedia.googlesource.com/aom/+log/v2.0.1..refs/heads/applejack\n\n1. Start with version information of ‘0:0:0’ for each libtool library.\n2. Update the version information only immediately before a public release of your software. More frequent updates are unnecessary, and only guarantee that the current interface number gets larger faster.\nN/A\n\n3. If the library source code has changed at all since the last update, then increment revision (‘c:r:a’ becomes ‘c:r+1:a’).\n\nv2.0.1 should have been 2.(0 + 1).0 at this stage; to allow potential patches\nto that tag we can make this 2.2.0.\n\n4. If any interfaces have been added, removed, or changed since the last update, increment current, and set revision to 0.\n\nNo changes to the API or ABI; leave current as is.\n\n5. If any interfaces have been added since the last public release, then increment age.\n\nNo additions to the API; leave age as is.\n\n6. If any interfaces have been removed or changed since the last public release, then set age to 0.\n\nNo other changes to the API; leave age as is.",
