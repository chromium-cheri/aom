Also, we can have 4x16 blocks now (but their mi_row shouldn\u0027t be odd, either).\n\nI looked in is_chroma_reference(), but it doesn\u0027t do any offsetting like this. Did you mean set_skip_context()? It does do a (mi_size_high[bsize] \u003d\u003d 1) check, but again I don\u0027t understand why.\n\nMaybe this should be an assertion instead? I\u0027m okay if you want to leave it as is, though.",
