      "message": "Marco: Thank you very much for writing this fix. As a backup plan, I think we should partially revert Cheng\u0027s commit 3abb1b0 as you suggested this morning. After studying issue aomedia:3349, I prepared a partial revert CL:\n\nhttps://aomedia-review.googlesource.com/c/aom/+/185543\n\nA problem with this CL is that it makes it less clear how `initial_dimensions` should be used because the usage pattern is less consistent than before.",
