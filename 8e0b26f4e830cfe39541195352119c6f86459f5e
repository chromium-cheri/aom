      "message": "I see. We thought this would be okay to do because quite a few functions already effectively require SSE4.1+ (aom_blend_a64_* in the decoder, and several encoder-side functions, don\u0027t have SSE2 or SSSE3 versions). However, if it is important to keep SSSE3 support, we can restore the appropriate functions, and still keep a decent chunk of the savings here.",

      "message": "That said, I do think there\u0027s a strong case to be made that we already de facto didn\u0027t support pre-SSE4 machines - on looking into it more, there are a *lot* of functions, including core decoder functions, which only have SSE4.1 implementations. Combining that with the age of pre-SSE4 machines, I can\u0027t imagine libaom performed adequately on those machines to start with.\n\nSo the best thing to do is probably to have a discussion about what level of support is needed for such machines, and figure out some kind of formal policy here. I\u0027m happy to set up a tracking bug if you think that would be a useful place to have that discussion.",
