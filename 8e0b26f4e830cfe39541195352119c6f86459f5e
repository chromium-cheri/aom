      "message": "I see. We thought this would be okay to do because quite a few functions already effectively require SSE4.1+ (aom_blend_a64_* in the decoder, and several encoder-side functions, don\u0027t have SSE2 or SSSE3 versions). However, if it is important to keep SSSE3 support, we can restore the appropriate functions, and still keep a decent chunk of the savings here.",
