      "message": "Hi Yunqing\n\nThis patch stores the previous frame loopfilter levels in AV1_PRIMARY (under CONFIG_FRAME_PARALLEL_ENCODE macro). \nSince the previous frame lpf levels are used as the starting point for lpf level search for the current frame, in order to ensure that all the frames in a parallel encode set start with the same levels, this patch disables the end-of-frame store of lpf levels for the frames, except for the last frame in a parallel encode set.\n\nThis change is tested with integer, undefined, address and thread sanitizer tests locally. The cumulative quality impact of all the CLs in this dependent chain are given at https://aomedia-review.googlesource.com/c/aom/+/138324.\n\nPlease review this patch.\nThanks",
