This change is expected to be bitexact \nfor all configuration except application forced key or forward key frames enabled. We have \nverified it internally with borg runs for speed 2 and 5.  \nAfter this patch, we are planning to fix the same issue in research2, research-partition and \nmaster branches.\n\nPlease review,\nThanks\n",
