      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\n\nWe have added the default initialization of xd-\u003etile_ctx with common frame context (cm-\u003efc) in enc_row_mt_worker_hook(). This ensures that xd-\u003etile_ctx is initialized appropriately in encode stage even though master thread does not pick any encode job. As xd-\u003etile_ctx is updated now, we have reverted the change of passing cm-\u003efc instead of xd-\u003etile_ctx in av1_fill_lr_rates().\n\nWe verified that the following issue is not seen with this patch.\nhttps://bugs.chromium.org/p/aomedia/issues/detail?id\u003d3036\n\nWe also verified bit-match w.r.t. parent version for few test-cases.\n\nPlease review the patch.\n\nThanks \u0026 Regards,\nVenkata.",
