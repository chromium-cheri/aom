      "message": "Chi Yo:\n\nIn addition to the changes James suggested, I also changed \"any\" to \"either\" because this code considers only two neighbors (above and left).\n\nAlso, the \"unless\" part of this sentence can be clarified:\n- The condition in the \"unless\" part is mutually exclusive with the first condition, so \"unless\" sounds strange here.\n- \"Unless\" implies we don\u0027t move `*color_idx` by 1. But we also reset `*color_idx` to 0. I think the comment should say that.",
