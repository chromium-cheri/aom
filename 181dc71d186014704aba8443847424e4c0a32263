      "message": "I can verify that this commit fixed the issues on csgo.\nBut this also leads to a regression on sc_SlideShow.y4m in screen_content set (around 7%).\n\nHowever, combining the commit with BLOCK_8X8 prediction and this commit, we still have around 1.3% bitrate reduction on screen content set.\n\nAny idea on whether this is worth checking in?",

      "message": "This seems likely to create a case where a cut to black (i.e. blank screen or title screen) cannot trigger as a key frame. Likewise some slide shows of text (i.e. music with slides showing words) might not trigger key frames where we want them. How bad this will look will then depend on ARF positioning and boost around the transition.",

      "message": "I have dug up a couple of test clips I used for slide show evaluations back in 2018, that I think will probably show the issue I am concerned about on at least a couple of transitions. They are on a USB drive connected to my office machine (which I don\u0027t have direct access to at the moment) and the upload speed from there is slow, but I will link them too you as soon as I can get them up onto Google drive.",
