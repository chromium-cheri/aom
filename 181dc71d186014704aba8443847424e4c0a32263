      "message": "This seems likely to create a case where a cut to black (i.e. blank screen or title screen) cannot trigger as a key frame. Likewise some slide shows of text (i.e. music with slides showing words) might not trigger key frames where we want them. How bad this will look will then depend on ARF positioning and boost around the transition.",

They are on a USB drive connected to my office machine (which I don\u0027t have direct access to at the moment) and the upload speed from there is slow, but I will link them too you as soon as I can get them up onto Google drive.",

Consider screen share videos of presentations or other cases like the mixed format where a user creates a slide show of various photos for a wedding or holiday or whatever (not uncommon). They may choose to set the photos in a background of any colour.",
