But now since we have added the ref_best_rd !\u003d INT64_MAX check, there is a possibility that mv_diff being zero is a valid case and hence we have removed this assert.",

Hence we were to remove the assert.\n\nWe can still keep the assert by removing the checks we added in motion_mode_rd(), but this may increase chances of x-\u003emust_find_valid_partition\u003d1. Hence we preferred the current approach.\n\nPlease let us know your opinion.",
