      "message": "Hi Yunqing, \n\nThis patch fixes the memory leak in CDEF multi-threading. The issue arises when the number of workers change. We have corrected the de-allocation of CDEF buffers to be based on number of allocated workers. Also, we have taken care of freeing of \u0027*cdef_worker\u0027 and \u0027free_cdef_row_sync()\u0027 when the number of workers change. \n\nPlease review.\n\nThanks",
