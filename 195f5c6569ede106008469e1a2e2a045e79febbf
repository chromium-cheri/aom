      "message": "Hi Sarah, Debargha,\nWe have submitted a unit test to validate seamless switching between sub-gop config and default encoder strategy. In the test, switching of sub-gop config and selection of sub-gop size for ‘enh’ config happens randomly.\n\nDuring the validation, we have identified few sanitizer errors in the unit test. We have captured our observations in BUG\u003daomedia:2889. As per our study and tests, the issue is present without overlay frame movement related changes as well.\n\nHence, we have currently disabled the unit test by default. Please review the patch.\nThank you.",
