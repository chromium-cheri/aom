Replace the aom_reader_has_error() call with an aom_reader_has_overflowed() call.\n\nI did the latter, because it matches the intention of the original code better. Is this OK?",

      "message": "I audited the code to see when the corrupted flag is actually checked. As far as I can determine, it is never checked more often than once per tile. But you are already checking aom_reader_has_overflowed() after each tile. So, while I do not think it breaks anything to leave these lines in as you have them here, I think it is just wasted computation (not nearly as much as checking on every symbol, though, so probably not a huge deal either way).",
