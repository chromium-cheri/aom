      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\n\nWe tried to extend the speed feature to speed presets 0, 1, 2. There was no/little encode time reduction for speed presets 0, 1 and the trade-off is not encouraging as well. The results, for speed preset 2, are as given in the table below. Please note that the BD-rate and speed data are generated on patchset2 (for all presets). We have extended the speed feature for speed\u003d2 in patchset 3 after rebasing to the latest version. Please review and merge this patch.   \n \n                      Instruction Count     BD-Rate Loss %\ncpu-used  Resolution    Reduction %      avg.psnr  ovr.psnr   ssim\n 2         LOW RES         0.724          0.0123    0.0147   -0.0015\n 2         MID RES         2.009         -0.0122   -0.0052    0.0066\n 2         HD RES          1.170          0.0151    0.0177    0.0157\n 2         AVERAGE         1.151          0.0060    0.0098    0.0061\n",
