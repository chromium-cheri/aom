      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\n\nThis patch is related to the Issue 2843 (https://bugs.chromium.org/p/aomedia/issues/detail?id\u003d2843#c2). The issue is seen when must_find_valid_partition is 1 in key frames due to the absence of the reset of ‘quad_tree_idx’. The absence of reset was leading to crash in av1_intra_mode_cnn_partition(). We felt that ‘cnn_output_valid’ should also be reset as CNN evaluation may not happen at the time of branching. Though the issue is caught after the introduction of ‘prune_sub_8x8_partition_level’ sf, the issue is present in parent version as well (as per our understanding). \nAs per borg tests, the change is bit exact for speed preset 6 with no speed impact. For other presets 0 to 5, bit match is verified locally (for few test-cases). \nPlease let us know your opinion on this patch and merge the same in case of no issues.\nWe are also checking if setting of must_find_valid_partition to 1 could have been avoided and shall submit a patch based on the progress.\n\nThanks \u0026 Regards,\nVenkata.",
