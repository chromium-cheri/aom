      "message": "This is workaround scaling that I put in a while back, right? We are constantly fidgeting with the scaling constants and then coming up with new ways of overflowing them. \n\nMy 2c: The int solver is simply not well done, it needs an overhaul. One needs to track worst-case stat magnitudes and scale down as needed at places where we lose the least precision. Until then it may be a good idea to shift back to the double precision solver.",
