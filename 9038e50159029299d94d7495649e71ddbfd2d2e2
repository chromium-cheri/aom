      "message": "This is fine but there will be many cases where you could actually have pruned out DCT_DCT and you search it anyway. The issue is that there is a case where the pruning function prunes out everything except for illegal types for the final tx_size, in which case you are actually using DCT_DCT but the loop thinks it is something other than DCT_DCT. Currently, there is a continue statement in that case, but it should actually probably do this check after the entire search and revert the tx_type to DCT_DCT if the found type is not legal. You can check this patch in for the time being, but maybe add a TODO to make this fix so you get all of the benefit from the pruning.",
