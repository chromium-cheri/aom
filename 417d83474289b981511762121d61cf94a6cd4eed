I have reinstated #15 to be same as #13. \n\nAlso, question for the SWCs: since there is a new flag (FLEX_STEPS) coming into this research branch, will it be okay to merge EXTQUANT and FLEX_STEPS when ready into this branch? Since all changes are in config flags it should be easy to track them.  ",
