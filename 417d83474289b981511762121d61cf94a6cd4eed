      "message": "Looks like patch set #14 from Krishna was a spurious one that reverted some of the changes until #13. I have reinstated #15 to be same as #13. \n\nAlso, question for the SWCs: since there is a new flag (FLEX_STEPS) coming into this research branch, will it be okay to merge EXTQUANT and FLEX_STEPS when ready into this branch? Since all changes are in config flags it should be easy to track them.  ",

If are updates planned to EXT_QUANT, then combining may be better. I am trying to figure how to rebase to these new updates in ext_quant commit.",

In general, I don\u0027t like to have code for two experiments mixed together. it is very hard to manage given the size of this patch. it took me at least 3 days every time I need to do a rebasing.

The idea was have EXT_QUANT patch with common changes and create a separate patch FLEX_STEPS to be able to compare.  But I can also create the FLEX_STEP patch completely independent of EXT_QUANT if that is what you meant and think it is desirable.\n\nHow did the patch #14 have an impact in the current patch.  I took research_anchor + git am ext_quant_patch + git apply flex_steps_patch + git commit, should not affect ext_quant_patch? ",
