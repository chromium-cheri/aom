      "message": "Hi Yannis: Thank you for writing this CL. Unless we can quote a statement from the AV1 specification that supports this CL, I am afraid that I have to decline it. libaom is considered the reference implementation of AV1, so it needs to generate compliant bitstreams. I did not find anything in the AV1 specification that says the Temporal Delimiter OBU may be omitted if still_picture is equal to 1, or more generally, if the coded video sequence has only one Temporal Unit.\n\nI suspect a source of the confusion is that \"Temporal Delimiter\" sounds like a separator between two Temporal Units and therefore it seems that the Temporal Delimiter OBU may be omitted if there is only one Temporal Unit. But the Temporal Delimiter OBU is actually a marker for the beginning of a Temporal Unit.",
