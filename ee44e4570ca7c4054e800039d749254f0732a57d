      "message": "I kind of hate all of the static INLINE functions in this header that are not really inline functions and just exist here because there\u0027s no corresponding C file. Can we just leave the definition of this function in cfl.c? I think that\u0027d actually be better. You can leave a comment on the declaration in this header to say where to find it, if it makes you feel better.\n\nUnless I\u0027ve missed something, cfl.c already includes onyxc_int.h, so it should have anything available to it that onyxc_int.h does (even if \"include what you use\" suggests it might not be a bad idea to repeat some of the includes).",
