      "message": "I remember this function was worked on before to resolve the difference between c and simd. Looks like recent codec changes revealed more mismatch (i.e. more points in borg results became mismatch.) Moreover, mismatch of this function hides mismatch issues of other parts of code. This CL disabled simd temporarily. I don\u0027t think this will impact encoder speed much, but I can double check about that. If we couldn\u0027t make it match with c code, we might need to introduce a method for c/simd testing.",
