      "message": "Looking at Jenkins (https://build.aomedia.org/jenkins/job/libaom__static_analysis/8646/mode\u003ddeep/warnings10Result/new/) it would appear that the variables cx_data and cx_data_size are unused.\n\nIt follows that, if I call write_superframe_index(ctx) and don\u0027t store the results I don\u0027t detect any impacts on the encode/decode process.\n\nFeels weird not using the index size. Let me know what would be the best thing to do with the index size.",

      "message": "Ignoring the index_size in the next patch would result in not writing an index to a superframe at all, which surely will cause a problem. It\u0027s okay for the command line encode/decode process without the use of an index for a superframe, but the index should be used by all other potential usages that call into the core of AV1 in need of parsing out the superframe index first before the decoding of any picture(s) contained within the superframe.",
