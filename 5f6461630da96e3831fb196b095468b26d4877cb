      "message": "Hi Wan-Teh, Frank,\n\nIn var based partitioning code, the variable force_split is used to indicate whether to split a partition or to choose from none, rectangular and split partitions. This CL enumerates the possible states for this variable in order to facilitate the addition of new states.\n\nThis is a bit-exact change and is verified to have no impact on encode time or on the coding performance. For libaom AV1 video encode, bit-match is verified (w.r.t. parent commit) for \u0027GOOD\u0027, \u0027RT\u0027 and \u0027ALLINTRA\u0027 encoding modes for a few contents with different encoding configurations.\n\nPlease review.\n\nRegards,\nJayasanker.",
