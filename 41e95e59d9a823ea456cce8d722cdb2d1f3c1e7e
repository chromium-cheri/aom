      "message": "It would be good to add a test to test/decoder_api_test.cc, to make it concrete what is the problematic call sequence.\n\nI expect that only an initialized \u0027ctx\u0027 should be passed to aom_codec_error_detail(). So if aom_codec_dec_init() fails, I would not call aom_codec_error_detail().\n\nAnother way to view this is: if it is correct to call aom_codec_error_detail() on the \u0027ctx\u0027, then we should also need to call aom_codec_destroy() on the \u0027ctx\u0027.",
