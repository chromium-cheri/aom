      "message": "It seems odd that for (video mode speed \u003e 7) resoln \u003e\u003d 2560x1440 will use much lower split threshold than resoln \u003c 2560x1440 (3.5x vs 8x). I think its better to remove this last else condition (resoln \u003e\u003d 2560x1440) for video speed 7, so the increase in split threshold applies there too.",
