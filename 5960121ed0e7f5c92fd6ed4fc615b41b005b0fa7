      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\n\nIn this CL, we have introduced a level 2 cdef search method for speed 3 based on resolution. The tradeoff for resolution \u003e\u003d 720p (HDRES2) was not within the limits even though the overall trade-off was fine. Hence, enabled this setting in speed 3 for resolution \u003c 720p.\n\nPlease find below detailed borg result:\n                Instruction Count       BD-Rate Loss(%)\ncpu Resolution   Reduction(%)      avg.psnr   ovr.psnr  ssim   \n3     LOWRES2      0.888           0.0207     0.0261    0.0156   \n3     MIDRES2      1.209          -0.0052    -0.0187    0.0176   \n3     HDRES2       0.000           0.0000     0.0000    0.0000   \n3     Average      0.699           0.0052     0.0025    0.0111\n\nIn the commit message, BD rate impact column:\n[+] sign is for BD-Rate drop\n[-] sign is for BD-Rate improvement\nThe instruction count reduction specified has been measured using command:\n$ perf stat -e instructions:u ./aomenc â€¦\n\nPlease review the patch. \n\nThanks \u0026 Regards, \nVenkata",
