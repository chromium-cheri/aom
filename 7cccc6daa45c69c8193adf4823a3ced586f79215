      "message": "It is possible to make a little more valid checking here on the same-sided compound refs for jnt-comp, as currently has_uni_comp_refs() only guarantees both reference frames are either in the set of {LAST, LAST2, LAST3, GOLDEN}, or both in the set of {BWDREF, ALTREF2, ALTREF}.\n\nIt may be better to use the frame_offset to check whether two reference frames are on the same side or not, that is, to check whether the frame_offsets of the two reference frames are both smaller than that of the current frame, or both larger.\n\nIt is possible that a BWDREF/ALTREF2/ALTREF frame in fact is located before the current frame.",
