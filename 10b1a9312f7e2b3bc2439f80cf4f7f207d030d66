      "message": "Hi Wan-Teh, Frank,\n\nIn this CL we have improved the conditions used to call av1_init_wedge_masks() and av1_rc_init_minq_luts() functions. Also, the arguments of the function av1_initialize_enc() are renamed as suggested in review comments of the CL (https://aomedia-review.googlesource.com/c/aom/+/156482/5/av1/encoder/encoder.c).\n\nGlobal tables related to wedge masks are not required for allintra encode. Whereas min_q tables related to rate control are not required for ALLINTRA (with rc_end_usage as AOM_Q), but the same is required in GOOD/RT encode. Hence, we have improved the conditions used to call the respective initialization functions. \n\nFor libaom AV1 video encode, bit-match is verified (w.r.t. parent commit) for \u0027GOOD\u0027, \u0027RT\u0027 and \u0027ALLINTRA\u0027 encoding modes for a few contents with different encoding configurations. It was also verified that the output of AVIF encode is bit-exact w.r.t. parent version for a typical image dataset.\n\nPlease review.\n\nRegards,\nMudassir.\n",
