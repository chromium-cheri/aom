      "message": "Hi Yunqing, Marco,\nIn the parent version, reuse of inter predicated samples in encode_b_nonrd() is disallowed for Luma plane if nonrd_check_partition_merge_mode speed feature is enabled. It is due to following scenarios.\n- PARTITION_NONE cannot reuse predicted sample as while evaluating PARTITION_SPLIT the predicted sample is overwritten\n- Predicted samples generated by encode_b_nonrd() call cannot reuse across DRY_RUN_NORMAL and OUTPUT_ENABLED modes as after the function call the buffer holds reconstructed samples\n\nThis patch enables reuse of inter predicated samples in encode_b_nonrd() by appropriately handling the above two scenarios. Once the patch is merged we are planning to study the possibility of reusing the predicted sample across DRY_RUN_NORMAL and OUTPUT_ENABLED modes (scenario 2).\n\nThis patch impacts RT speed 7 as the nonrd_check_partition_merge_mode speed feature is enabled for the speed level.\nPlease check the BORG test results for the RT preset.\n```\n               Instruction Count        BD-Rate Loss(%)\ncpu   Testset   Reduction(%)    avg.psnr   ovr.psnr    ssim\n 7        rtc      0.896         0.0000     0.0000    0.0000\n 7   rtc_derf      1.027         0.0000     0.0000    0.0000\n```\nIn the commit message:\n[-] sign indicates encode time increase\n[+] sign indicates encode time reduction\n\nThe instruction count reduction specified has been measured using command:\n`$ perf stat -e instructions:u ./aomenc`\n\nWe ensured that the change is bit-exact for RT and Good presets.\nPlease review the patch.\n\nThank you.",
