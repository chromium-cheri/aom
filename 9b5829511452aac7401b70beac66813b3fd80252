Like obmc_adapt_weight, or ncobmc_adapt_weight, whichever applicable.\nBTW, regarding the jenkins failure, CHECK_MISSING means a new config flag is added to the codebase but not added to the list that Jenkins will test compiling, you can ask jzern@, he will manually add it. And better to have a separate patch just for adding the experimental flag.",
