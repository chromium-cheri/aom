      "message": "Hi Wan-Teh,\n\nWe have submitted this CL as a follow up patch as per the review comments given in CL https://aomedia-review.googlesource.com/c/aom/+/151561. This CL renames the function and identifiers related to variance computation in compute_avg_log_variance() as follows. \ncompute_mapped_var() ⇒ compute_avg_log_variance\nmapped_source_var ⇒ avg_log_src_variance\nmapped_recon_var ⇒ avg_log_recon_variance\nAlso we have cleaned up the functions allocate_src_var_of_4x4_sub_block_buf() and  allocate_gradient_info_for_hog()  by passing only cpi and deriving the respective buffer pointers inside these functions for the memory allocations.\n\nFor libaom AV1 video encode, bit-match is verified (w.r.t. parent commit) for \u0027GOOD\u0027, \u0027RT\u0027 and \u0027ALLINTRA\u0027 encoding modes for a few contents with different encoding configurations. It was also verified that the output of AVIF encode is bit-exact w.r.t. parent version for a typical image dataset.\n\nPlease review the patch.\n\nRegards,\nMudassir\n",
