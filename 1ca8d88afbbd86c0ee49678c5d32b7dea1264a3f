It seems to assume that we could have multiple target-seq-level-idx in one command line, in this case we need to make sure we have enough room for ARG_KEY_VAL_CNT_MAX if we do use the key \u0026 val API for it.",

Even though set_config_arg_key_vals() handles \"target-seq-level-idx\" (at lines 854-861), that code path is not taken right now because the set_config_arg_ctrls() call (which is called before set_config_arg_key_vals()) will have handled the option.",
