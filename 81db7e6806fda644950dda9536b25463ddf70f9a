      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\nThis CL combines perform_coeff_opt and perform_coeff_opt_based_on_satd speed features. We also unified input thresholds used by the speed features accordingly. \n\nPlease review the patch and let us know the approach we have taken to consolidate the sf is fine.\n\nThe changes are bit-exact and no impact on quality (verified locally).\n\nRegards\nAkshata\n",
