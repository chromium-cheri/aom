      "message": "I think the coding gains come from allowing lower qp when buffer_level can go negative (which will happen after first key frame), which can cause frame drops in the application, so we generally avoid this. The condition: p_rc-\u003ebuffer_level \u003e p_rc-\u003eoptimal_buffer_level would be more appropriate (or maybe 1/2 of optimal level is safe enough).\n\nWe do incorporate source_sad into rate control in adjust_q_cbr(), but more conservative based on buffer level.",

      "message": "The threshold below which we force worst_quality (line 974) is ~1/8*optimal_level (this is to avoid getting close to 0 to avoid frame drops) so maybe try threshold of 1/4 * p_rc-\u003eoptimal_buffer_level. Looks like the gains are from allowing lower qp after the key frame (where the buffer level can go down below optimal level).",
