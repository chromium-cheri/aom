      "message": "Hi, Hui.\nThis is the cleaned code for affine-based MV generation. Since AWCY is still pending. If convenient, I hope you can run it for me in your Borg environment to better track the bugs. I have commented in the code to show my thinking while implementing that. If you feel something wrong, we can discuss on that. \n\nI will also follow the suggestions today to change the int types to float ones and retest it if resources are available. \n\n\nThanks!\nJinkun ",
