      "message": "This CL adds memory allocation checks to the buffers allocated in `tf_alloc_and_reset_data()`. The calls to free the buffers are cleaned up, as the same will be taken care by `tf_dealloc_data()` invoked in `encoder_destroy()`. Also replaced `malloc()` and `free()` calls associated with `tf_data-\u003etmp_mbmi` with `aom_malloc()` and `aom_free()`.\n\nThis change is bit-exact and has been verified using bitstream-match tests for a combination of various configuration values for --threads, --tile-rows, --tile-columns, --cpu-used, --end-usage, --row-mt, --fp-mt, etc. Validated all unit-tests with sanitizers (address and thread) and valgrind.",
