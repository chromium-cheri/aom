      "message": "The reason for skipping AArch32 in SAD4D was \u0027vpaddq_u32()\u0027 - used in the reduction  after the main loop - being an AArch64-only intrinsic. SAD and the variance functions here don\u0027t make use of any AArch64-only intrinsics so I thought we might as well enable the paths for AArch32 too.\n\nThere aren\u0027t any good options on AArch32 for that 32-bit reduction in SAD4D so it wouldn\u0027t be much faster - if at all - than the non-dot-product path anyway.",
