      "message": "Just FYI: Here is the Note in Section 5.8.1, which I don\u0027t fully understand:\n\n  Note: The exact syntax of metadata_obu is not defined in this\n  specification when metadata_type is equal to a value reserved\n  for future use or a user private value. Decoders should ignore\n  the entire OBU if they do not understand the metadata_type. The\n  last byte of the valid content of the data is considered to be\n  the last byte that is not equal to zero. This rule is to prevent\n  the dropping of valid bytes by systems that interpret trailing\n  zero bytes as a padding continuation of the trailing bits in an\n  OBU. This implies that when any payload data is present for this\n  OBU type, at least one byte of the payload data (including the\n  trailing bit) shall not be equal to 0.\n\nSo I decided to ignore the whole thing, including the trailing bit.",
