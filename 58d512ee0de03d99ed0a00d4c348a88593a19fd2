      "message": "This won\u0027t work on its own since it\u0027s gated by `HAVE_ARM_CRC32` which is doing a __ARM_FEATURE check in `cpu.cmake`.\n\nIt\u0027s also only compatible with gcc/clang, but I don\u0027t believe Microsoft\u0027s compiler is setting `__ARM_FEATURE_*`. I would keep the variable to make any updates easier in the future.",
