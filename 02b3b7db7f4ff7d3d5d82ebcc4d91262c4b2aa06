      "message": "Suggest adding examples for \"reflect\" and \"symmetric\", since terminologies change (for example, I used the goofy terms \"mirror half\" and \"mirror one\" in my presentations). Technically speaking, they are both mirror reflections of the input signal, except the position of the mirror changes\n\nSymmetric: d | c |  b | a || a | b | c | d -\u003e mirror is at \"0\" position, i.e. actual frame boundary, since first pixel (a) coordinate is \"0.5\"\nReflect: d | c | b || a | b | c | d -\u003e mirror at \"0.5\" position, which is the coordinate of the first pixel, thus the rational for \"mirror half\" term used in the past.\n",
