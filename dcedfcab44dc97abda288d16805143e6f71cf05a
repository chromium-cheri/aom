      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\nThis patch removes calc_frame_data_update_flag() which was required only during FPMT simulation to mark the last frames in a parallel set to update to ppi. It is now handled in av1_init_parallel_frame_context() and separate function is not required.\n\nThis patch also refactors and renames few FPMT functions.\n\nPlease review.",
