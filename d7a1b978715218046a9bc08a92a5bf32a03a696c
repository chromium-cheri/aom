      "message": "My intent of putting numbers is to make speed features\u0027 impact easier to identify if we review them later.\n\nSince we know the numbers are the last time the speed feature is introduced/revisited, at some point we could test and compare against the numbers in the future.\n\nBut I understand that different test scenarios could give different numbers, and the numbers associated with it might not be comprehensive. I will remove them.",

The non-zero segment superblocks are used for cleanup/quality boost so prefer not to force bigger partitions there. There will be some change in stats but safer visually.\n\nThis is similar to use we use the \"force_large_partition_blocks\" speed feature below, where the threshold increase is conditioned on content (source_sad) and segment_id. But this is only set for speed 9/10.",
