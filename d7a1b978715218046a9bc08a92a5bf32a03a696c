The non-zero segment superblocks are used for cleanup/quality boost so prefer not to force bigger partitions there. There will be some change in stats but safer visually.\n\nThis is similar to use we use the \"force_large_partition_blocks\" speed feature below, where the threshold increase is conditioned on content (source_sad) and segment_id. But this is only set for speed 9/10.",
