      "message": "Yuan: I still don\u0027t understand the `av1_resize_and_extend_frame_c()` function. But if I were to extend it to support 4:4:4 and 4:2:2, I would naively do something like this:\n\n- split `factor` into `factor_x` and `factor_y`.\n- when setting the values of `factor_x` and `factor_y`, consider not only `i` (the plane) but also `subsampling_x` and `subsampling_y`.\n\nDid you consider this approach?",
