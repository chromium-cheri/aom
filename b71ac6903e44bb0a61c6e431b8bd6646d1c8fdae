      "message": "This statement is misleading. The CIEDE number shows only a 0.46% improvement.  The PSNR Cb and PSRN Cr numbers are somewhat nonsensical since they 1) include the cost of coding luma in the rate and there are a lot more bits spent on luma than chroma, and 2) don\u0027t take into account losses in overall image quality where luma goes down and chroma goes up.  Maybe AWCY should stop reporting them.",

      "message": "No, it does not make sense in this particular case.  If you look at the individual runs, some of the sequences show gains in luma PSNR and some show losses.  It is only the average that winds up close to neutral.  Whereas, CIEDE is almost always a gain.",
