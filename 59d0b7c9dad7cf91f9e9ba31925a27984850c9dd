      "message": "Hi Zak,\n\nMy apologies for the very late review.\n\nPlease make sure you sign the contributor license agreement: https://aomedia.org/license/#contributor-license-agreements\n\nWe will need to rebase this CL to the current libaom source tree. If the 10-bit code is not working, we can still consider checking in your code as work in progress provided that the 8-bit code is intact and we disable external access to the 10-bit code (e.g., by leaving the img-\u003ebit_depth \u003e 8 check in av1/av1_cx_iface.c).\n\nAlso, it seems that we can move the JXL thread parallel runner changes to a separate CL, because those changes seem independent.",
