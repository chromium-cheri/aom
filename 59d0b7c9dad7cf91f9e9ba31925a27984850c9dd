If the 10-bit code is not working, we can still consider checking in your code as work in progress provided that the 8-bit code is intact and we disable external access to the 10-bit code (e.g., by leaving the img-\u003ebit_depth \u003e 8 check in av1/av1_cx_iface.c).\n\nAlso, it seems that we can move the JXL thread parallel runner changes to a separate CL, because those changes seem independent.",
