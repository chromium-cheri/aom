      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\nWe have created a patch to revert TPL frame buffer optimization with appropriate fix. The issue was caused by an incorrect update of ‘ybf-\u003emonochrome’ flag. In encoder/decoder, the flag is set for monochrome streams, whereas in the encoder we used the flag to avoid the memory allocation of chroma planes based on use_y_only_rate_distortion speed feature. Hence, in this patch we have corrected the logic by adding a new flag ‘alloc_y_plane_only\u0027.\n\nThe memory savings for this patch is the same as reported in the earlier patch.\nPlease review.\nThank you.",
