      "message": "I think it would be more readable to update all the source lists in one conditional. Instead of what we have here now, it ends up looking like this block from draco that controls its transcoder tool support:\n\nhttps://github.com/google/draco/blob/master/CMakeLists.txt#L517\n\nI think it\u0027s easier to maintain and hack on the config if it\u0027s all in one conditional block instead of scattered across a couple hundred lines of script. This is just my preference, though.\n\n(Note: Applies throughout where appropriate)",

Since you are the original author of libaom\u0027s cmake build system, I will be happy to go with your preference.\n\nMay I do that in a separate CL? The reason is that it will be easier to review because it will only involve moving code fragments around.",
