      "message": "I think it would be more readable to update all the source lists in one conditional. Instead of what we have here now, it ends up looking like this block from draco that controls its transcoder tool support:\n\nhttps://github.com/google/draco/blob/master/CMakeLists.txt#L517\n\nI think it\u0027s easier to maintain and hack on the config if it\u0027s all in one conditional block instead of scattered across a couple hundred lines of script. This is just my preference, though.\n\n(Note: Applies throughout where appropriate)",
