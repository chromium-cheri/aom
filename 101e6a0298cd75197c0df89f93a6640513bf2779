      "message": "Sure, I will run some tests shortly. However, I suspect the impact will be small - due to the ordering constraints coming from the way restoration stripes are handled, there isn\u0027t much that can be done in parallel on small videos with 128x128 size restoration units in the first place. So going to 256x256 units shouldn\u0027t lose us much.",

      "message": "Okay, I\u0027ve run the tests with the addition of --threads\u003d2 and collected the results now. The BDRATE and encode times are broadly similar to the single-threaded case.\n\nIn fact, the worst encode time increment with 2 threads is +0.406%, less than the +0.512% seen in the single-threaded tests. And the speed:quality tradeoffs are all well within our goals for the different speed settings.",
