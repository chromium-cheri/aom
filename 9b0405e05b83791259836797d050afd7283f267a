      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\n\nIn this patch, the bypassing of transform search based on skip rd is made more aggressive at lower quantizers for speed preset 4 (extension of the earlier CL https://aomedia-review.googlesource.com/c/aom/+/117101 ).  We have also corrected the comments related to the case where prediction is good.\n\nWe observed ~0.9% BD rate drop for crew_cif in speed 4, the respective speed gain is 8%.\n\nThis is a bit exact change for speed presets \u003c\u003d 3 (verified locally).\n\n                     Instruction Count     BD-Rate Loss(%)\ncpu-used  Resolution   Reduction(%)   avg.psnr  ovr.psnr   ssim\n   4       LOW RES        4.467        0.2211    0.2274    0.1724\n   4       MID RES        1.850        0.0904    0.0904    0.0676\n   4        HD RES        4.173        0.1020    0.0838    0.0935\n   4       Average        3.730        0.1465    0.1435    0.1177\n\nIn the commit message, Quality Loss column:\n[+] sign is for BD-Rate drop\n[-] sign is for BD-Rate improvement\nThe instruction count reduction specified has been measured using command:\n$ perf stat -e instructions:u ./aomenc â€¦\n\nPlease review the patch.\n\nThanks \u0026 Regards,\nVenkata.",
