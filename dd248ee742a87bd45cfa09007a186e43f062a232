      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\n\nIn this patch, we moved the initialization of \u0027thread_data-\u003estart\u0027 variable from launch_enc_workers() to create_enc_workers(). This enables the re-use of the function launch_enc_workers() for the cases where thread_data is not the first argument of the multi-thread hook function. This patch facilitates CDEF multi-threading. Also, we have renamed the function launch_enc_workers() to launch_workers(), as launch_workers() is used to launch workers in different modules like first pass, temporal filter, tpl, global motion.  \n\nThis is a bit-exact change with no speed impact (verified locally). \n\nPlease review the patch.\n\nThanks \u0026 Regards,\nVenkata.",
