Are these two macros preferred?\n\nI didn\u0027t know about this macro. That might help hide any dependencies. The change was due to a LSC and eventually googletest is going to pick up a dependency on absl.\n\nThis set is now a little confusing to the reader since the macro doesn\u0027t take gtest_filter for instance. I wonder if the local should be renamed to new_filter/updated_filter or so.",
