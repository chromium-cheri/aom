Heap memory analysis is done and observed that the change is negligible.\n2. Average encode time impact of these patches is ~0.7% for --rt preset and negligible for --good preset. The overhead is due to top and bottom line buffer changes. The buffers are inevitable to facilitate row-level MT in cdef frame.\n",
