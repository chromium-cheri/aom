      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\n\nFor real time encoding with cost update frequency set to COST_UPD_TILE/COST_UPD_OFF, tile ctxt is not updated at superblock level. Thus, it is not required to update the CDF\u0027s during encoding. This leads to encode time reduction as \u0027update_cdf()\u0027 function is not called.    \n\nThe patch is verified to be bit-exact (single thread Borg runs for rt presets and local multi-thread runs on few contents) and the encode time reduction for rt preset with threads 4, tile cols 4, row-mt 1 (averaged over 360p, 480p, 720p, 1080p) are as follows:\n\n            Encode time\ncpu-used    Reduction (%)\n   7             1.90\n   8             2.05 \n   9             2.47\n \n\nThe single thread instruction count reduction achieved for rt preset (Borg suite) are as follows\n\n             Instruction count\ncpu-used     Reduction (%)\n   7              1.41\n   8              1.78\n   9              1.94\n \n\nPlease review.",
