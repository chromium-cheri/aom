      "message": "I remember before adding this check the encoder would fail some assertions. This was because the reference frame scheduler tries to remove identical reference frames, and LAST_FRAME has a higher priority than ALTREF. However being OVERLAY_UPDATE, the encoder later asserts that it has to have an ALTREF enabled. Maybe things are different now?",
