      "message": "A factor was missing in the highbd path in https://aomedia-review.googlesource.com/c/aom/+/141121, which caused a big drop of gain in highbd. We have not tested highbd path in OPFL_COMBINE_INTERP_GRAD_LS until recently the drop of gain emerges after the intrinsic implementation was done. Now the ideal gain will show after this fix.",
