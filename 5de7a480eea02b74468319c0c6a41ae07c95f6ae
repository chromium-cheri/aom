      "message": "Sorry, it wasn\u0027t very clear from the way I worded it.  There are 3 AVG steps at the end of the 8-point Type-IV DST which I have left included so that, should we need to, we could use the Type-IV instead of the Type-VII as our 1-D DST (which would indeed fail the 16-bit overflow tests on 8x8 DCT-DST without the AVG steps).\n\nBecause the 8-point Type-IV is embedded in the 32-point DCT after two rounds of +/- butterfly steps (plus half of the transform) it is not possible for those three multiplies to exceed 16-bits when the 32-point DCT is used as the column transform.  The AVG steps are only needed when the DST is used as the row transform, and even then only in the smaller 2-D transforms where the output still fits in 16-bits.\n\nDropping these three AVG steps improves the 32-point DCT MSE by 31%:\n\nOld MSE: 2.720187834703266909473252932461e-05\nNew MSE: 8.6810950818190055103089342036782e-06",
