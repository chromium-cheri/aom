      "message": "Should we assign another frame_context_idx value to \"cpi-\u003erefresh_golden_frame\"? It may not have any benefit manifested in our own encoder, as we simply either update a KEY_FRAME or an OVERLAY frame to golden, but for code complete.\n\nFurther, in the experiment of ext-refs, there is another frame type, which is indicated by cpi-\u003erc.is_last_bipred_frame. This type of frames are different from the other normal Inter frames as they will not be used as reference for the encoding of any other frames.\n\nLastly, I prefer to use if-else if-else here, instead of assign a common value to cm-\u003eframe_context_idx first - would think it would be more legible. Up to you.",
