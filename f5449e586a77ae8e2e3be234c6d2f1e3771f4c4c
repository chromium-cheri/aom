      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\n\nIn this patch we have skipped wavelet energy calculation in first pass. For the case where deltaq_mode is configured as DELTA_Q_PERCEPTUAL in second pass and configured differently in first pass encoding, \u0027frame_avg_wavelet_energy\u0027 is calculated in second pass encoding.  \n\nFollowing are the results:\n \n              Instruction Count\n  cpu-used      Reduction(%)\n      3              0.40\n      4              0.59\n      5              1.14\n      6              1.50\n\nThe instruction count reduction specified has been measured using command:\n$ perf stat -e instructions:u ./aomenc ...\n\nThe speed gains for cpu-used 0,1,2 are negligible.\n\nPlease review this patch.\n\nThanks",
