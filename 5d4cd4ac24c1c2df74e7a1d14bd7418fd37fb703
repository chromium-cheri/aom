      "message": "Two general comments after reviewing part of the code.\n\n1) Please add the second merge request (or CL) to turn on the compiler flag, and the third merge request to turn this compiler flag off (since this coding tool is decided to be turned off by default). Please refer to CWG-B047 for more details.\n2) Please also add the run-time flag for new_tx_partition. Since  we may remove the compiler flag later on, but will still keep run-time flag. So it\u0027s prefered to have run-time flag for the new coding tool. Madhu is also helping to evaluate whether it\u0027s easy or hard to add the run-time flag for this coding tool. Please feel free to comment. @Madhu.",
