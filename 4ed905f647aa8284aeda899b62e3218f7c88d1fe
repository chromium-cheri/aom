      "message": "This line is little hard to follow. Add comment or maybe split max_delta_down into a function?\n\nIt seems that if the previous frame has overshoot (rc_1_frame\u003d-1) then you want the delta to be smaller (1/16 instead of 1/8 if rc_1_frame\u003d1)? But if previous frame has overshoot the current frame QP should generally be pushed up so it wouldn\u0027t hit this limit much?",

      "message": "The purpose was to lower allowed max_delta_down if previous frame has overshoot. But, to make the logic less confusing, I removed all changes except the frame complexity part.\nAlso, currently only allow this bit estimation for aq_mode\u003d0 case, so this won\u0027t affect anything critical. Will experiment more carefully before enabling it for aq_mode \u003d3.",
