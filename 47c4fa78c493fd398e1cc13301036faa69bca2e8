      "message": "The patch includes two optimisations: SIMD and reduced memory footprint on the decoder side.  Since they\u0027re both optimisations and non-normative it made sense to me to lump them together.  But I the SIMD abstraction stuff is perhaps a major addition worthy a review whereas the memory optimisation a smaller tweak for which it may be overkill do to an extensive review, so in that case it might be better to separate, or the memory optimisation can just be ignored in this review.",
