      "message": "I would highly recommend to unify the model as resolution independent.\n\nConsider the situation where you have 4 CIF sequences putting together to construct a 4CIF clip By checking the frame dimension, one would set use_planewise_strategy \u003d 1. Yet by design it seems not to recommend to use it.",

      "message": "This seems like a historical problem. Our current codebase uses two different strategies for low-res (YUV-filtering) and hd-res (planewise-filtering).\n\nFrom my experiments, using more frames can always improve YUV-filtering, even on hd-res videos. But since we only use YUV-filtering on low-res videos for now (resaon: planewise-filtering achieves better performance on hd-res, even better than the improved YUV-filtering), I keep this setting.\n\nBut you are correct that it is better to have a unified strategy. That\u0027s what Cheng and I are working on.",
