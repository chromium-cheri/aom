      "message": "The hard-coded 4x4 here is the only thing that depends on 4:2:0, right? I think that should be very easy to generalize, and is probably something that should be done before this lands (or at the very least, you should add asserts that you\u0027re in 4:2:0, but I think it\u0027s approximately as much work to just make this work for the other subsampling formats).",
