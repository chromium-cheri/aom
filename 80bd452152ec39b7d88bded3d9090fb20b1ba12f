      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\nAfter analyzing the bugs reported, we have identified that the \u0027cdef_row_mt\u0027 structure memory allocation is not updated for some of the cases with change in row count.\n\nFor example: Consider a scenario where frame height is increased from \u0027576(9 rows)\u0027 to \u0027896(14 rows)\u0027 for same frame width. In such cases, we either try to free more than allocated data or try to write into unallocated memory space.\nThis CL fixes such issues by updating the memory allocation in runtime based on row count.\n\nWe verified the patch locally.\nPlease review the same and let us know your thoughts.\nThank you.",
