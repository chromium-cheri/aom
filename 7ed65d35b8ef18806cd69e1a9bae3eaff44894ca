      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\n\nIn this patch we have skipped motion search w.r.t third reference in firstpass.\n\nWe have added a warning in \u0027process_first_pass_stats()\u0027 function. We considered addding a warning in \u0027validate_config()\u0027 function. However, as some parameters (i.e., enable_auto_arf, gf_min_pyr_height, cq_level) related to disabling the ML were not yet set before the \u0027validate_config()\u0027 function call we added the warning in process_first_pass_stats(). Following are the results:\n \n              Instruction Count\n  cpu-used      Reduction(%)\n     3             0.41\n     4             0.60\n     5             0.91\n     6             1.21\n\nThe instruction count reduction specified has been measured using command:\n$ perf stat -e instructions:u ./aomenc ...\n\nThe speed gains for cpu-used 0,1,2 are negligible.\n\nPlease review this patch.\n\nThanks",
