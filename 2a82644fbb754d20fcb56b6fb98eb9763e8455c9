      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\nWhile testing the multithread implementation of cdef frame, we identified an issue in width of the line buffer. After our recent modification, width of the line buffer is set as mi_cols * 4. This change ensured that width of the line buffer (luma) is always multiple of 8. But this requirement is not fulfilled for some resolutions where width of chroma plane is not multiple of 8.\n\nFor example: consider a frame width \u003d 200 and 4:2:0 subsampling, width of line buffer (chroma) is 100 which is not multiple of 8. In such cases, \"line buffer copy\" is reading 4 samples beyond the line buffer boundary.\n\nIn order to fix this issue, in this CL we ensured that width of line buffer for luma is always multiple of 16.\n \nThis patch is tested locally for bit match. Please review. Thank you",
