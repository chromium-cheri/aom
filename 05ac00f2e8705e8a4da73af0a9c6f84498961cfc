I believe we can assume the U and V planes have the same subsampling_x (and subsampling_y), and test only one of these.",

      "message": "1. Even if `num_planes \u003d\u003d 1`, mbd-\u003eplane is always pre-defined as mbd-\u003eplane[MAX_MB_PLANE]. But you are right that we do not need the check if `num_planes \u003d\u003d 1` since it will be meaningless (not a memory problem).\n\n2. I am just being careful. I also assume subsampling_x equals to subsample_y before.",
