      "message": "Hi Chi-Yo, Jingning, Lin, Yunqing,\n\nIn this CL, the NEON implementation of aom_hadamard_16x16() is modified to match the output with that of C implementation. This CL also enables relevant unit-test. \n\nThe NEON implementation of aom_hadamard_16x16() is modified similar to SSE2 implementation in the CL below:\nhttps://aomedia-review.googlesource.com/c/aom/+/163202\nTo facilitate the change, we introduced a temporary buffer to store intermediate data as final output is written out of order in this CL. \n\nWe observed that the latest implementation reduces function time (using unit-test) by ~1.66%(in 32-bit build) and increases function time by ~0.93%(in 64-bit build). \n\nPlease review the CL.\n\nRegards,\nRanjit",
