      "message": "Currently, an allocation failure in `av1_tf_info_alloc()` is handled using `cm-\u003eerror` and when this function is invoked by `av1_check_initial_width()` call in `encoder_encode()`, it will result in a SEGV error in case of allocation failure since `cm-\u003eerror` is not initialized at this point. In order to fix this, this CL modifies the return type of `av1_check_initial_width()` and `av1_tf_info_alloc()` to propagate the error status so that the appropriate `error_info` can be used for error reporting.\n\nThis change is bit-exact and has been verified using bitstream-match tests for a combination of various configuration values for --threads, --tile-rows, --tile-columns, --cpu-used, --end-usage, --row-mt, --fp-mt, etc. Validated all unit-tests with sanitizers (address and thread) and valgrind.",
