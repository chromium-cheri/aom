      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\n\nIn this patch we have extended the speed feature \u0027enable_dc_only_blk_pred\u0027 for speed preset 5 to bypass the tx type search if the residual variance of the block is very low as compared to qstep based threshold. \nThis speed feature is enabled for normal modes and disabled for winner modes for speed 5, whereas for speed 6 it is enabled for all modes.\n\nPlease find the detailed borg results for speed 5 below.\n\n                      Instruction Count       BD-Rate Loss(%)\ncpu-used  Resolution   Reduction(%)     avg.psnr  ovr.psnr    ssim  \n   5       LOW RES       0.722           0.0595    0.0612    0.1080 \n   5       MID RES       1.209          -0.0027   -0.0272   -0.0855\n   5        HD RES       0.978           0.0616    0.0636   -0.0424 \n   5       Average       0.906           0.0420    0.0361    0.0055\n\nAlso, this patch has a small fix while updating the best_rd_stats-\u003erate for early predicting skip block for very low residual variance. This fix is applicable to cases when tx block size is smaller than the block size (which arises for winner modes). We re-evaluated the speed-quality trade-off for speed 6 with the fix, the results are similar to that of the original patch (https://aomedia-review.googlesource.com/c/aom/+/118144).\n\n                      Instruction Count       BD-Rate Loss(%)\ncpu-used  Resolution   Reduction(%)     avg.psnr  ovr.psnr    ssim  \n   6       LOW RES       1.251           0.1653    0.1676    0.2562 \n   6       MID RES       1.749           0.1947    0.1956   -0.1802\n   6        HD RES       1.550           0.1534    0.1475   -0.0213 \n   6       Average       1.448           0.1703    0.1697    0.0439\nIn the commit message, Quality Loss column:\n[+] sign is for BD-Rate drop\n[-] sign is for BD-Rate improvement\nThe instruction count reduction specified has been measured using command:\n$ perf stat -e instructions:u ./aomenc â€¦\n\nPlease review the patch.\nThankyou.\n",
