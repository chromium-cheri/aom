      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\n\nIn this patch we have renamed variables like \u0027allocated_sb_rows\u0027 which are used in both first-pass and encoder multi-threading. The name \u0027allocated_sb_rows\u0027 would be a misnomer in case of first-pass multi-threading as first-pass multi-threading is done at macroblock row level. Also, we have removed some unnecessary initialization and conditions in tpl multi-threading. Please review.\n\nThanks",
