      "message": "The function av1_cnn_activate_c() is used to get the output through mapping of the input using one of the activation functions as per the enum \u0027ACTIVATION\u0027. In the parent commit, these activation functions were invoked through \u0027get_activation()\u0027, using function pointers which resulted in a function call in every iteration. This CL optimizes this function by declaring these activation functions as INLINE and refactoring \u0027av1_cnn_activate_c()\u0027 accordingly. In this process of refactoring we have cleaned up the function \u0027get_activation()\u0027. The CL is verified to produce bit-exact results.\n\nFor AVIF still-image encode with tune\u003dssim,\n```\n                         Encode Time\ncpu-used                 Reduction(%)\n    6                      0.988\n```\nInstruction count reduction seen (for AVIF encode) is quoted below.\n```\t\n                       Instruction Count\ncpu-used                 Reduction(%)\n    6                      0.768\n    3                      0.111\n```\nFollowing are the instruction count reduction results when libaom allintra frame encoding (50 frames) was tested for a borg setup:\n```\n                       Instruction Count\ncpu-used                 Reduction(%)\n    6                      0.873\n    3                      0.094\n```\nLibavif commit used for testing: babcfca04c6164008055cfcb54941fdcb46213c3",
