      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\nIn this CL, we have modified the thresholds of the speed features partition_search_breakout_dist_thr and partition_search_breakout_rate_thr to (1\u003c\u003c25) and 200 respectively for --rt, speed \u003d 4.\nThis change is applicable for speed 4 only, as the speed feature is related to recursive partition. \nBd-rate drop is slightly away from trade-off for rtc (trade-off achieved is 0.0621).\n\nPlease find the detailed borg result below.\n\n CPU Resolution   Instruction Count      BD-Rate Loss %\n                      Reduction %   avg.psnr  ovr.psnr  ssim                                    \n   4    rtc_derf         7.504      0.0355    0.0614   -0.0795 \n   4      rtc            3.676      0.2282    0.2357    0.2784\n   4    Average          5.543      0.1479    0.1631    0.1293\n \nIn the commit message, BD rate impact column:\n[+] sign is for BD-Rate drop \n[-] sign is for BD-Rate improvement. \nThe instruction count reduction specified has been measured using command: \n$ perf stat -e instructions:u ./aomenc â€¦ \nFor other speed levels, this is a bit-exact change with no impact on speed (verified locally for few test cases). \n\nPlease review the patch.\n\nThank you.",
