      "message": "A few things:\n\n1) This appears to work just as well as my suggestions in https://bugs.chromium.org/p/aomedia/issues/detail?id\u003d2474\n\n2) As I mentioned in the bug and CL where this issue originated I think we should remove this entirely, or message(FATAL_ERROR) when someone attempts to use CONFIG_LOWBITDEPTH. The libaom build is complex enough without flag compatibility trickery to support users who can\u0027t be bothered to adjust their configs when a flag changes.\n\n3) If FORCE_HIGHBITDEPTH_DECODING really means the opposite of CONFIG_LOWBITDEPTH, don\u0027t we need an if/else that sets FORCE_HIGHBITDEPTH_DECODING to the opposite of the setting value passed with CONFIG_LOWBITDEPTH:\n\n    if(DEFINED CONFIG_LOWBITDEPTH)\n      if(CONFIG_LOWBITDEPTH)\n        ...\n      else()\n        ...\n      endif()\n    endif()",
