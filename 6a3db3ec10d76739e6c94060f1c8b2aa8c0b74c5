      "message": "Agree.  It\u0027s like that so clpf_block could know whether it was at an edge or not, but that\u0027s no issue now.  Also, I can switch the src/dst order to match that of dering.  And finally, we don\u0027t have to senc bx and by to clpf_block anymore (for y we were subtracting bx,by and passing bx,by to clpf_block so it could add them again!)\n\nThese changes make this patch a big larger, though, but I think it makes sense to do this cleanup right away.",

      "message": "It\u0027s not exactly the same thing, for a case !dst \u0026\u0026 !clpf_strength, but that combination never happens so what you suggest is fine.  The confusing bit here is that when od_dering() is called from pickcdef, we don\u0027t want to convert to 8 bit (at least, not now, later perhaps we want to compute mse based on 8 bit data).  So pickcdef will use NULL as the 8 bit destination, which makes the function behave as before.",
