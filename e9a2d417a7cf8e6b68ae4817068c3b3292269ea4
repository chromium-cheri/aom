      "message": "This CL resolves the valgrind issues seen after the SIMD improvements done in https://aomedia-review.googlesource.com/c/aom/+/173321. \nIn functions compute_stats_win5_avx2() and compute_stats_win7_avx2(),  256-bits load instruction is used to read data from the ‘dgd’ buffer. When LRU (Loop restoration unit) width is not multiple of 16, the instruction could read uninitialized data. Hence, memset() is done explicitly for an extra row to silence the valgrind issue.",
