      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\n\nIn this patch, we have fixed pruning of reference frames in global motion search. \n\nFor frames of type ARF/GF update, pruning of certain reference frames (according to \u0027selective_ref_frame\u0027 speed feature) may be disabled (based on tpl data) during encoder mode decision. However, during global motion search, reference frames were always being pruned. In this patch, for ALTREF/GOLDEN frames, we disable pruning of reference frames during global motion search. \n\nThe results of this patch along with its parent (https://aomedia-review.googlesource.com/c/aom/+/116241) are detailed below: \n\n                       Encode Time          BD-Rate Loss(%)\ncpu-used  Resolution   Reduction(%)   avg.psnr   ovr.psnr      ssim\n   2       LOW RES      0.907          -0.1125     -0.0901    -0.2248\n   2       MID RES      1.951          -0.1002     -0.0854    -0.1406\n   2       HD RES       1.197          -0.0029     -0.0027    -0.1303\n   2       Average      1.235          -0.0755     -0.0621    -0.1713\n\n               \nIn the table above, BD-Rate Loss(%) column:\n[+] sign is for BD-Rate drop\n[-] sign is for BD-Rate improvement\nThe encode time reduction specified has been measured using command:\n$ perf stat -e instructions:u ./aomenc â€¦\n \nPlease review the patch.\nThank you.\n",
