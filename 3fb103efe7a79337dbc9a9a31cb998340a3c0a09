      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\n\nThis CL enables the speed feature av1_ml_predict_breakout for preset 0 of the high bit-depth\nencoding path. The sf ml_predict_breakout_level is updated to have values of 0 to 3 in order\nto facilitate the use of a conservative threshold for speed 0.\n\nThe overall speed and BD rate numbers (given below) are computed over the entire test suite\nincluding HD res – since the sf is disabled for HD res, the numbers for those clips are \nconsidered to be 0 while obtaining the “Average” numbers.\n\n\n                      Instruction Count        BD-Rate Loss(%)\ncpu-used  Resolution    Reduction(%)   avg.psnr  avg.psnr  ovr.psnr   ssim\n\t\t\t\t\t8-bit\t  10-bit\n   0       LOW RES        3.519         0.0476    0.0466    0.0588    0.0907\n   0       MID RES        4.404         0.0851    0.0869    0.0756    0.0333\n   0       Average        2.841         0.0441    0.0442    0.0458    0.0462\n\n\nBit-exactness for the low-bd path and hbd speed 1 to 6 has been verified locally.\n\nPlease review the patch.\nThank you.",

      "message": "Hi Yunqing, \n\nThe sf is disabled for HD res and above in lbd encoding, hence, we enabled the sf only for lowres and midres for hbd path as well. \n\nWhen we tried enabling the existing model for hd res in lbd encode, the results were beyond trade-off for speed 0 to 3. However, we feel that by making the pruning more conservative, it may be possible to extend this sf to hd res as well. We shall plan to do some experiments towards this, and keep you updated with the results.\n\nRegards,\nVishesh",
