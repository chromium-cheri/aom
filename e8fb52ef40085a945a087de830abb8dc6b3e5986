      "message": "This CL is mainly intended to show where things go wrong when I have the realtime only build decode the three SVC test vectors. The loop_restoration_read_sb_coeffs() call here will read from the bitstream using aom_read_symbol(). So if this is skipped, the caller will fail in the check_trailing_bits_after_symbol_coder() call.\n\nNote: I am worried that the compiler may warn about the empty for loop body in a Release, realtime only build. I have tested with GCC and Clang on Linux.",
