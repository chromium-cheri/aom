      "message": "Hi Sarah, Debargha,\nThis patch fixes potential deallocation of subgop_config_str or subgop_config_path pointers twice. The issue can be reproduced when a ‘null’ pointer is passed in three consecutive control calls (AV1E_SET_SUBGOP_CONFIG_STR or AV1E_SET_SUBGOP_CONFIG_PATH).\n\nFor example,\nLet input string of three consecutive control calls are {“enh”, null, “enh”}. \nIn this case, av1_change_config() function tries to free same memory region ( held by ‘subgop_config_str’) in 2nd and 3rd control calls respectively. This was leading to a crash issue in encoder. \n\nThis patch fixes the issue by resetting the pointer after freeing the memory. Please review the patch.\nThank you.",
