      "message": "It seems like currently we will always follow the luma partition exhaustively correct?\nI think this is good as a first step until we can verify the correctness of SDP + ERP.\n\nAfter that, we will need to inspect the luma tree recursively to see how much further split is done. As an example, we could have a counter for the number of further partitions under the current luma node, and continue to follow luma partition only if the counter is greater than a threshold.",
