      "message": "In the temporal filter, the block size at which prediction needs to happen is decided by doing motion estimation at block sizes 32x32, and for four sub-blocks of size 16x16. This CL introduces a speed feature ‘allow_sub_blk_me_in_tf’ to avoid 16x16 sub-block motion search by using source variance calculated at 4x4 sub-block level. If the variation between the minimum and maximum variance is large then only allow motion search at sub-block level and vice versa. Currently, this sf is enabled only in speed 6 for MIDRES2 and HDRES2 resolutions.\n\nThe below shows Borg test results for speed 6.\n```\n                 Instruction Count         BD-Rate Loss(%)\ncpu   Test_Set     Reduction(%)      avg.psnr   ovr.psnr    ssim\n 6    LOWRES2        0.000           0.0000     0.0000      0.0000\n 6    MIDRES2        0.766          -0.0159     0.0449      0.0311\n 6    HDRES2         1.384          -0.0566    -0.0766     -0.0486\n 6    Average        0.717          -0.0242    -0.0106     -0.0056\n```\nAs trade-off is poor for LOWRES2 dataset, the sf is disabled for the same. Extending this sf to speed 5 is not within the trade-off.",
