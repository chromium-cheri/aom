We have separated them as the following tools/algorithms that are disabled by default.\n1. Global motion\n2. Compound mode\n3. Inter-Intra mode\n4. Loop filter\n5. Wedge mode\n6. OBMC\n7. Recode\n8. Recursive Partitioning\n9. Cost update frequency\n10. Interpolation filter search\n\nThis patch is bit-exact and no impact on encoder speed.\nPlease review the patch.\n\nThank you.",
