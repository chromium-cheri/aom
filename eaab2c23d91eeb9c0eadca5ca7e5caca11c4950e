      "message": "This CL introduces \u0027aom_internal_error_info\u0027 structure in EncWorkerData and adds a jump target in enc_worker_hook() to facilitate propagation of error from the worker threads to the master thread in case of tile-MT. sync_enc_workers() is also modified to read and propagate the correct error details. aom_internal_error() calls in encoder_encode() are also modified to pass the correct error details.\n\nThis change is bit-exact and has been verified locally using bitstream-match tests for a combination of various configuration values for --threads, --tile-rows, --tile-columns, --cpu-used, --end-usage, --row-mt, etc. Also, performed all unit-tests with sanitizers (address and thread) and valgrind for memory leaks.",
