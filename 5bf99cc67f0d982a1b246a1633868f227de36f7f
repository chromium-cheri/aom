      "message": "LGTM. The new comments are very informative. Thank you very much.\n\nI\u0027m still curious if you know why the NONE prediction mode correlates with the evaluation of rectangular partitions. Is this a purely empirical observation? Or is there an intuitive, plausible justification for this?",
