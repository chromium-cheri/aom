      "message": "Hi Christopher,\n\nThank you for the reply. I have a question for you at line 2365.\n\nBefore I saw this bug, I had been assuming that by default the stderr stream is\nunbuffered. While researching this bug, I found that this is only a convention\non Unix, and C99 only requires that stderr be not \"fully buffered\", which means\nstderr can be unbuffered or line buffered. So I guess mingw-w64 gcc on Windows\nchose to make stderr line buffered, even though it differs from the Unix\nconvention.\n\nHere is an excerpt from C99:\n\n    7.19.3 Files\n    \n    ...\n    \n    3  When a stream is unbuffered, characters are intended to appear from the\n       source or at the destination as soon as possible. Otherwise characters\n       may be accumulated and transmitted to or from the host environment as a\n       block. When a stream is fully buffered, characters are intended to be\n       transmitted to or from the host environment as a block when a buffer is\n       filled. When a stream is line buffered, characters are intended to be\n       transmitted to or from the host environment as a block when a new-line\n       character is encountered. ...\n\n    ...\n    \n    7  ... As initially opened, the standard error stream is not fully buffered;\n       the standard input and standard output streams are fully buffered if and\n       only if the stream can be determined not to refer to an interactive device.",

      "message": "For this location, I\u0027m not sure if it\u0027s really needed as the main reason why the original issue was created was because a lot of stream readers rely on the presence of `\\r`, `\\n`, or `\\r\\n` to determine when to send an event for the client to read from, such as the one for dotnet https://referencesource.microsoft.com/#System/services/monitoring/system/diagnosticts/AsyncStreamReader.cs,226, and they are often used to determine when to read from aomenc to get the current frame count and fps, so I do not think it\u0027s as important to flush right before the end of a pass.\n\n\nI could send a cl for adding one here just in case if it\u0027s wanted",
