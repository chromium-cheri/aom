      "message": "Hi Eric and Jian,\n\nRegarding the second issue in the Bug:aomedia:3531: I have a fix here for an issue with a speed feature with resizing and psnr_calc. Modified a unittest to verify the fix. Let me know if this is the same issue you\u0027re seeing. If not, can you give more detail on how to repro what you\u0027re seeing. Thanks.",
