      "message": "This was my attempt at documenting the difference.  The OD_AVERAGE() macro is only used to fix a 16-bit overflow in the smaller transforms (not to introduce a non-linearity or to fix an IEEE1180 failure).  The plan is to do some experimentation to see if it is possible to implement OD_AVERAGE() without the need for the +1 rounding bias.",
