      "message": "Good question. My thinking was that:\n- This is simpler, and it should still have same effect as clipping to INT_MAX.\n- Even if we wanted to clip sum_subblock_mse, we would still need to use int64 type to make sure addition doesn\u0027t overflow (or we will need some other logic to check overflow)\n\nWe could still do explicit clipping separately if we want.",
