      "message": "Hi Wan-Teh,\n\nWhen we tried generating the statistics related to header cost information of palette_size, it is observed that about ~80% of the times header cost increases as palette_size increases. So, if header cost corresponds to lower palette_size is more than best_rd, then the evaluation of higher palette_size can be skipped as the chances of winning are less. The following 2 patches are planned to implement early exit based on header cost of palette_size.\n1) Change the evaluation order of palette_size search, to facilitate early exit (current CL)\n2) Introduce early exit logic based on rdcost calculated using palette_size header rate (will be submitted as dependent CL)\n\nThis change is a bit-match change w.r.t. parent version for majority of the test-cases. Following are instruction count reduction results when AVIF encode was tested for a typical image dataset. Bit match is seen for all contents except 1 or 2 contents in speed preset 3, 4 and 5.\n\nwith --tune\u003d\u003dpsnr option, all the contents are bit-matching for speed presets 0 to 6.\nwith --tune\u003d\u003dssim,\n   \n           Instruction Count             BD-Rate Loss(%)\ncpu-used     Reduction(%)     psnr     avg.psnrCb  avg.psnrCr  ssim\n   3           1.042          0.0000   0.0002     -0.0002      0.0000\n   4           1.436          0.0000  -0.0001      0.0001      0.0000\n   5           1.656         -0.0001  -0.0002      0.0001      0.0000 \n\nThe rare mis-match is seen because of rdcost comparison (i.e. this_rd \u003c *best_rd), which will change winner palette_size w.r.t. parent version in case there are multiple palette_size values with same this_rd.\n\nFor testing video encode, considered borg setup and screen content set as inputs. For allintra video encoding, bit-match is observed for speed presets 0 to 6.\n\nFor good video encoding, mis-match is seen for 1/2 contents in screen content set for speed presets 2 and 5.\n\n               Instruction Count                    BD-Rate Loss(%)      \n     cpu-used    Reduction(%)     avg.psnr  avg.psnrCb  avg.psnrCr  ovr.psnr   ssim  \n         2        -0.011          0.0029    0.0088      0.0037      0.0042     0.0011\n         5        -0.001         -0.0012   -0.0014     -0.0001     -0.0052    -0.0010\n\nPlease review the patch.\n\nThanks \u0026 Regards,\nVenkata.",
