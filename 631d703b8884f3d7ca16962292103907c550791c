      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\n\nThis CL fine tunes skip_intra_pred_if_tx_skip speed feature for better speed quality trade-off. In the parent version, the sf skips intra mode search if the block turns out to be transform skip. In order to improve trade-off, we modified the logic conservatively by checking NEWMV mode along with transform skip. This modification improves the quality of speed 7 and 10. We also enabled the sf for speed 8 as the result is within trade-off.\nPlease check the resolution-wise speed and quality results as mentioned below.\n\n                    Instruction Count        BD-Rate Loss(%)       \ncpu-used Resolution   Reduction(%)    avg.psnr   ovr.psnr    ssim  \n   7        rtc         -0.156        -0.1137    -0.1387   -0.1526 \n   7      rtc_derf      -0.232        -0.0779    -0.1004   -0.1233 \n   7      Average       -0.193        -0.0988    -0.1227   -0.1404 \n   8        rtc          0.707         0.0458     0.0457    0.0862 \n   8      rtc_derf       2.541        -0.0679    -0.0660    0.0201 \n   8      Average        1.602        -0.0016    -0.0009    0.0586  \n  10        rtc         -0.196        -0.0637    -0.0807   -0.1598 \n  10      rtc_derf      -0.177        -0.2131    -0.2150   -0.1928 \n  10      Average       -0.187        -0.1259    -0.1367   -0.1736 \n\nIn the commit message :\n[-] sign indicates encode time increase \n[+] sign indicates encode time reduction \nThe instruction count reduction specified has been measured using command:\n$ perf stat -e instructions:u ./aomenc â€¦\n\nPlease review the patch.\nThank you.",
