      "message": "It is possible that the encoder may choose different reference frames as LAST2 or LAST3 for the current coded frame down the road. Hence, it is suggested to add a speed feature flag here and simply turn it on by default. This way it also helps us keep track of all reference frame related speed features at the encoder side.",

      "message": "Done.\n\nMake it under the speed feature flag now. I wonder if it is ok to turn it on in speed 0?\nWould be good if we could start tracking 1080p speed 0 (within 24 hrs) at some point.\nWe can remove it easily at any time if desired. Thoughts?",
