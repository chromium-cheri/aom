      "message": "This is still just as much of a problem as the last time I commented on it.\n\nYou can\u0027t re-use the segmentation map of a previous frame without creating all of the same problems that we were trying to solve by getting rid of temporal prediction (it\u0027s just another form of temporal prediction).\n\nSpecifically, with temporal layers (and probably also spatial layers, but I\u0027m not going to think about that very hard) or in video conferencing with dropped packets, you can\u0027t assume that current_frame_seg_map contains the same thing in the decoder that it contained in the encoder because the previous frame you decoded won\u0027t necessarily be the same. To do this correctly you\u0027d have to have a buffer on a per-reference-frame basis (as in Thomas\u0027s no_frame_context_signaling experiment), and you\u0027d still have to figure out how to handle the case where the reference frame resolution and the current resolution don\u0027t match.\n\nJust make this whole function call read_intra_segment_id() and you won\u0027t have any of these problems.",
