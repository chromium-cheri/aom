      "message": "Hi Yaowu,\n\nI wrote this CL because I previously contributed libgav1\u0027s FilterIntraPredictor_SSE4_1() to libaom and I thought I should also contribute FilterIntraPredictor_C() for consistency. I did not look at the code before I started, so I didn\u0027t know the only main difference was in the \u0027buffer\u0027 variable until I finished the CL.\n\nI answered the performance question in test/filterintra_test.cc.",
