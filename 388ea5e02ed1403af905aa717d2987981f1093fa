      "message": "I find it useful for debugging inside the lib, and an analysis tool outside of the library or the existing analyzer could find this useful as well. Mainly I want to avoid duplication-- there\u0027s quite a few use cases for OBU type string conversion even if implementation of the support is trivial.\n\nNote that I intend to expose some other OBU utilities via the public API some time in the future (get_obu_type() is already a candidate, but read_obu_header() and valid_obu_type() would probably fit as well).",
