      "message": "there\u0027s a mix of python code in this tree and as it wasn\u0027t very commonly developed the group never took a stance on style or implementation details (we probably should if more is going to appear), so I won\u0027t get too involved in the details. minimally though can you run pylint against the code and keep to 80 characters? I think that is consistent with the rest of the code base.",
