Note: If we go with this form, then we should NOT use the array-size-commented-out form:\n    int16_t hbuf[/*16*/]\n\nI think the form with array size is the best\n    int16_t hbuf[16]\nprovided that the reader understands the array size is ignored and serves only as documentation.\n\nThe form with the array size commented out\n    int16_t hbuf[/*16*/]\nmakes it clear the array size is ignored, but is a little verbose.",
