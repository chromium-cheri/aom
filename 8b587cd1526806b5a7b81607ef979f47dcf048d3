      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\n\nThis patch initializes the reference refresh index in cpi-\u003eref_refresh_index for the frames encoded in a parallel encode set of lower layer frames (FP2).\nSince the 2 parallel frames in a FP2 set are both reference frames, the refresh index of frame_parallel_level 2 frame needs to be computed ahead of time, after accounting for the changes due to frame_parallel_level 1 frame. In this patch, the reference refresh indices (cpi-\u003eref_refresh_index) for the 2 parallel frames in a FP2 set are computed during the init of parallel cpis, which are then used to obtain the corresponding refresh_frame_flags.\n\nThis change is bit exact in the default path and FPMT path (verified locally on a few test cases).\nPlease review.\n\nRegards,\nRemya",
