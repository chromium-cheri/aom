      "message": "In the parent commit, the allocation failure in `smooth_filter_noise()` is not handled by the caller function. In this CL, the return type of  `smooth_filter_noise()` is modified to return -1 in case of failure and `error_info` derived from `cpi-\u003ecommon` is passed to the caller function (`av1_estimate_noise()`) where `aom_internal_error()` is invoked.\n\nThis change is bit-exact and has been verified using bitstream-match tests for a combination of various configuration values for --threads, --tile-rows, --tile-columns, --cpu-used, --end-usage, --row-mt, --fp-mt, etc. Validated all unit-tests with sanitizers (address and thread) and valgrind.",
