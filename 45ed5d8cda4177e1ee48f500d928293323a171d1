      "message": "Hi James,\n\nAs you pointed out in the patch (https://aomedia-review.googlesource.com/c/aom/+/155366/4/aom_dsp/aom_dsp_rtcd_defs.pl#1126), the function aom_hadamard_8x8_dual() is specific to low bit depth. Hence, for better readability this CL renames aom_hadamard_8x8_dual() to aom_hadamard_lp_8x8_dual().\n\nEven though aom_hadamard_8x8_dual() is called for an 8x16 block, intrinsic is implemented such that hadamard txfm is performed at 8x8 level for two 8x8 blocks simultaneously. Hence, we preferred to rename as aom_hadamard_lp_8x8_dual() instead of aom_hadamard_lp_8x16().\n\nAlso, we are planning to submit a follow-up patch for the other issue which you pointed out in the patch (https://aomedia-review.googlesource.com/c/aom/+/155366/4/av1/encoder/nonrd_pickmode.c#897).\n\nThanks \u0026 Regards,\nVenkata.\n",
