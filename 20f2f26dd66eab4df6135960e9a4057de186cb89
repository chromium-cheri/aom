      "message": "Thanks for your comments Chi Yo. We did a test with forcing ref_mode_set_rt \u003d\u003d ref_mode_set_reduced earlier, and saw 0.63% bdrate gain with 0.7% speed loss, but it was tested on top of other changes.\n\nI will test the change (unifying the two ref_mode_set) alone on a cleaner codebase. If the bdrate/speed tradeoff looks good, I will submit it in the next CL, which would worth from code cleanup aspect.",
