      "message": "Hi Yunqing, Marco,\n\nThis CL refactors the model_skip_sb_y_large() function mainly for speed and to facilitate intrinsic changes. Please check the refactoring changes in the patch.\n1. Early return based on the ‘force_zeromv_skip_for_blk’ flag is moved to the beginning of the function which avoids some of the declarations.\n2. Refactored and combined the ‘for’ loops which updates ac_test and dc_test flags for speed-up. This change also removes the variables and conditions related to TX_SIZE 32x32.\n3. To improve modularity of model_skip_for_sb_y_large() function, some of the operations are abstracted into new functions. These changes are done to facilitate required changes in the dependent patch. (https://aomedia-review.googlesource.com/c/aom/+/167062).\n\nFor this patch, we observed ~0.15% instruction count reduction. (achieved mainly due to change #2). We also submitted a dependent CL (https://aomedia-review.googlesource.com/c/aom/+/167062), to avoid calculate_variance() for block sizes \u003e 32x32 and combined gains are mentioned in the dependent CL.\n\nPlease review the patch.\n\nThanks \u0026 Regards,\nAnupam.",
