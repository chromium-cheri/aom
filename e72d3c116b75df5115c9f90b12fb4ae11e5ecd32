      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\n\nThis patch fixes the issue reported in BUG\u003daomedia:2752. \n\nPlease note that in this patch we memset the \u0027left_data\u0027 and \u0027above_data\u0027 for every block. We have verified that there is no speed impact for both encoder and decoder with this change. \n\nIf this memset is to be avoided at every block level, we could consider the below two approaches. \n1. Make the arrays \u0027left_data\u0027 and \u0027above_data\u0027 as members of the structure MACROBLOCKD with size corresponding to high bit-depth use-case. This would result in negligible increase in memory footprint. \n2. Dynamically allocate the arrays \u0027left_data\u0027 and \u0027above_data\u0027 for low/high bit-depth case. This would require changes to encoder, decoder, multi-thread and non-multi-thread implementations. \n\nPlease let us know your opinion.  ",
