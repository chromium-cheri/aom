      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\n\nThis patch optmizes the computation of \u0027num_fp_contexts\u0027 for resolutions larger than 480p, if superblock size is 64x64, such that a parallel frame encode has 1/8th the theoretical limit of max_enc_workers. This limit was derived from empirical analysis.\n\nSo for a 1080p content, with SB size 128x128, max_num_enc_workers is 8 and hence the limit of \u00271/4th the max_num_enc_workers\u0027, enables fpmt when minimum 2 threads per frame are available. If the SB size is 64x64, max_num_enc_workers would be 15 and the limit of \u00271/8th the max_num_enc_workers\u0027 still enables fpmt when minimum 2 threads per frame are available thereby yielding the optimal performance.\n\nPlease review.\n\nRegards,\nRemya",
