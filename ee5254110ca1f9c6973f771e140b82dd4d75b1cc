      "message": "Please add a comment to point out that this function only approximates that requirement of the spec. The deviations from the spec\u0027s requirement are:\n\n1. The SequenceHeader struct does not include all the syntax elements of the sequence header OBU.\n\n2. Being bit-identical means defaulting a field to 0 and specifying a 0 value are considered different. I don\u0027t know if this difference actually matters to the sequence header OBU though.",
