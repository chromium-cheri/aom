      "message": "In the parent commit, `lf_sync` is accessed inside the `enc_row_mt_worker_hook()` function if `cpi-\u003emt_info.pipeline_lpf_mt_with_enc` is set to true. But `lf_sync` is initialized inside `lpf_pipeline_mt_init()` based on `lf.filter_level[]`. This can result in invalid access of `lf_sync` inside the setjmp target in case an error is encountered. This CL resolves this issue by accessing `lf_sync` with the same condition as it is initialized. \n\nWe have also abstracted the condition to a new function `lpf_mt_with_enc_enabled()`. Also avoided the use of enums `PLANE_TYPE_Y` and `PLANE_TYPE_UV` with `lf.filter_level` as `lf.filter_level(0,1)` corresponds to horizontal and vertical filter.\n\nThis change is bit-exact and has been verified using bitstream-match tests for a combination of various configuration values for --threads, --tile-rows, --tile-columns, --cpu-used, --end-usage, --row-mt, --fp-mt, etc. Validated all unit-tests with sanitizers (address and thread) and valgrind.",
