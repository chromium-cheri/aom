      "message": "I suppose right shifting `dequant_ptr[0]` erased lower bits and that might have led to the problem you mentioned in the commit message? Could you explain the problem further with sample input values since I added the bug in `highbd_quantize_fp_helper_c` function.\n\nAside from fixing the bug, I\u0027m a little concerned about increased operation inside loops (though it\u0027s just an additional left shift). But.. adding micro optimizations worsens code readability so I wonder if doing so should be convered in _SIMD_extension_name suffix functions. Ideally, branches should be removed and a number of executing operations should be reduced with SIMD instructions. It seems `highbd_quantize_fp_helper_c` function occupies around 10% of encoding time.",
