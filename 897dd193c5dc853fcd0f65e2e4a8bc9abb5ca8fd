      "message": "I\u0027m not sure that this logic is correct. If partition_cost[PARTITION_NONE] \u003d\u003d INT_MAX, I think that means \"Using PARTITION_NONE is very expensive. Don\u0027t do it.\"\n\nWith this patch, you increment this_rdc.rate by zero in this case (which I think means \"Hey, this is really cheap!\") I don\u0027t think that\u0027s what you want.\n\nShould it be something this instead?\n\nthis_rdc.rate \u003d (partition_cost[PARTITION_NONE] \u003c INT_MAX) ? this_rdc.rate + partition_cost[PARTITION_NONE] : INT_MAX;\n\nAnd similarly for this_rate_nocoef.\n\nAlso, do you have a reason for only making this change in the PARTITION_NONE case? Presumably, the signed overflow could happen on any of the other partition types too.",
