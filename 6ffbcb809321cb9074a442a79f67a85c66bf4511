      "message": "With this change, CONFIG_LOWBITDEPTH\u003d0 will force the decoder to use the HBD coding path.\n\nHowever, the encoder would still use the LBD coding path ; because the coding path decision hinges on the input frame buffer format, and here, the input is 8-bit YUV (to force the encoder to use the HBD coding path you need to convert the input buffers, as aomenc does).\n\nLBD/HBD paths currently give different results, so this unit test would raise encode/decode mismatches when \"./configure --disable-lowbitdepth\".",
