Please review.\n\nAnd also due to the recent changes in allintra for speed\u003e\u003d7, we observed that there is segmentation fault in speed\u003d8(for screen contents when intraBC is enabled). We have raised a bug for the same and shared our observation in BUG\u003daomedia:3099.\n\nThanks,\nAniket",
