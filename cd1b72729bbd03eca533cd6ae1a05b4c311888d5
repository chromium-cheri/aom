Is there a way to express a preference for the static library in CMake?\n\nThis was the wrong way to do it, though. It would result in a fully static build. `-Wl,-Bstatic` can be used, but it won\u0027t fix the Arch Linux issue. I don\u0027t think there\u0027s much value in forcing a static link for a system lib like this.",
