      "message": "I think we also want to transmit the strength (and filter the superblock) if the superblock has partitioning (when sb_type !\u003d BLOCK_LARGEST), otherwise we would not transmit anything when the top-left sub-block is skip but the rest of the superblock is non-skip.  And the same fix must be applied elsewhere in this patch.\n\nI suggest that we go for 22340 instead, but this patch is still useful as an independent verification.",
