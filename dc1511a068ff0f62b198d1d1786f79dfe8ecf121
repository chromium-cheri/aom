      "message": "Hi Wan-Teh, Yunqing,\n\nThe buffers \u0027tmp_pred_bufs[]\u0027 are used to hold temporary prediction results while encoding inter frames(i.e., used in handle_inter_mode(), OBMC prediction). Hence, the memory allocation for \u0027tmp_pred_bufs[]\u0027 is made conditional by avoiding the same for allintra encoding mode.\n\nFor libaom AV1 video encode, bit-match is verified (w.r.t. parent commit) for \u0027GOOD\u0027, \u0027RT\u0027 and \u0027ALLINTRA\u0027 encoding modes for a few contents with different encoding configurations. It was also verified that the output of AVIF encode is bit-exact w.r.t. parent version for a typical image dataset.\n\nWe validated the heap memory reduction for speed\u003d9 as well. \nFor AVIF image encode with speed\u003d9 and threads\u003d4,\n               HEAP Memory\nResolution     reduction(%)\t  \n360p-720p\t  2.20     \n\nPlease review the patch.\n\nRegards,\nAniket.\n",
