      "message": "Correct. I\u0027ve copied the convolution kernels across and renamed them. My intention is to go through convolve_neon.c and do a similar refactoring (mostly cosmetic) pass to what we\u0027ve just done in jnt_convolve_neon.c. After that I\u0027ll pull out common kernels and functionality into the header (which currently contains quite a few duplicate and redundant functions.) I didn\u0027t want to rename functions in the header right now as it would mean mangling code in convolve_neon.c before we do the rest of the refactoring.",
