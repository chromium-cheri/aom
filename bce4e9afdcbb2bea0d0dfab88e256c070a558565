      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\nMoving the utility functions to another .c file was not preferred as most of the functions are declared as INLINE. Otherwise we need to drop the INLINE directive that might increase the instruction count.\nHowever, in the updated patch we have reverted the code changes related to utility functions. Please let us know your thoughts. If required we can submit the changes related to utility functions in a separate CL.",
