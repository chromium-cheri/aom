      "message": "Hi Wan-Teh,\n\nThis CL optimizes the memory allocation of pixel_gradient_info by not allocating the same for chroma in case of monochrome.\n\nWe had also thought of an alternate approach by declaring pixel_gradient_info[PLANE_TYPES] and doing the memory allocation in a for loop with AOMMIN(num_planes, PLANE_TYPES) iterations. We preferred the current approach as the code change is minimal and cleaner.\n\nThis change is verified to be bit-exact for image and video encoding. We also validated that the memory reduction for monochrome all-intra encoding is as below:\n\n                  Memory reduction (%)\n Resolution     threads\u003d1      threads\u003d2\n    360p          0.3112         0.5939\n    480p          0.1873         0.3267\n\nHEAP memory reduction was measured using the command below.\n$valgrind --tool\u003dmassif ./aomenc ...\n\nPlease review.\n\nRegards,\nJayasanker.",
