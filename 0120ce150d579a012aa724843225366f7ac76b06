      "message": "When I extended this approach to GCC, I got a warning when usage_exit.c was compiled, because GCC\u0027s -Dno-deprecated-copy flag is C++ only.\n\nIt doesn\u0027t seem possible to restrict target_compile_options() to C++ files. So I went back to the add_cxx_flag_if_supported() approach. The downside is that all C++ files, not just those that include googletest headers, will disable these compiler warnings.\n\nNote: A possible solution is to generate usage_exit.cc. I remember one of the Arm engineers tried that (in the Chromium source tree).",
