      "message": "My only concern is that aom_realloc_frame_buffer() doesn\u0027t clear a lot of the variables in the YV12_BUFFER_CONFIG struct (e.g. color_primaries, monochrome etc.). I don\u0027t believe this will cause a problem, as I don\u0027t think the values are used in the loop restoration, but it would be good if you could double-check this. Ideally, it would be best if cm-\u003erst_frame could be memsetted at some point, but if this takes away the speed-up then it\u0027s not worth it.",
