Nit: This is not necessary, because we once we set pbi-\u003esequence_header_ready to 1, we never reset it to 0.\n\nWe zero-initialize the entire pbi structure, so pbi-\u003esequence_header_ready and pbi-\u003esequence_header_changed are both initialized to 0.\n\n2. I am wondering if we should reset pbi-\u003esequence_header_changed to 0 when we receive a temporal delimiter.",

      "message": "1. Done, removed the reset as suggested. \n2. Since one coded video sequence may have more than one TDs and repeated same Sequence Header OBUs are allowed to appear cross TDs while different sequence header OBUs are not not allowed within one coded sequence even they are separated by TDs. So my understanding is that we should not reset sequence_header_changed at TDs.",
