      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\n\nIn this patch, we abstracted the row-level code of mean square error calculation into a separate function to facilitate multithreading. Also, introduced a structure \"CdefSearchCtx\" and moved cdef search related parameters into the same. Buffers and variables which are related to block level are moved inside cdef_mse_calc_block() and functions common to single thread and multi-thread are moved to pickcdef.h. \n\nThis is a bit-exact change with no speed impact (verified locally). \n\nPlease review.\n\nThanks \u0026 Regards,\nVenkata.",
