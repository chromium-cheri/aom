      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\n\nWe noticed that cdef_find_dir() has only sse4.1 intrinsic optimization. This CL introduces AVX2 intrinsic optimization. The function is designed to compute CDEF direction for two 8x8 together to achieve better performance. In this patch we have also added relevant unit-test changes for the same.\n\nPlease check the encoder speed up results measured using timer and instruction count based as below. Please note timer based results are based on a limited set of test contents and instruction count is measured using Borg test.\n\nBased on Timer:\n       Encode Time\ncpu    Reduction(%)\n 7       0.250\n 8       0.278\n 9       0.210\n10       0.278\n\nBased on Instruction Count:\n     Instruction Count\ncpu    Reduction(%)\n 7       0.346\n 8       0.437\n 9       0.430\n10       0.477\n\nIn the commit/review message:\n[-] sign indicates encode time/instruction count increase\n[+] sign indicates encode time/instruction count reduction\nThe instruction count reduction specified has been measured using command:\n$ perf stat -e instructions:u ./aomenc\n\nThe speed gains for other presets are negligible. Bit match is verified for few streams of decoder, for \u0027GOOD\u0027 and \u0027RT\u0027 encoding modes. Please note that the changes corresponding to NEON will be taken care of in a separate patch in future.\n\nPlease review the patch.\n\nThanks \u0026 Regards,\nVenkata\n",
