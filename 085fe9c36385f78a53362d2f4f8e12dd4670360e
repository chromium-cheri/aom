      "message": "This CL fixes the nightly unit test failure reported in aomedia:3570 due to unaligned store in\n`av1_resize_horz_dir_avx2()` by making use of the existing function `xx_storel_32` to perform the 32-bit store operation to the output buffer.\n\nValidated that the fix resolves the reported unit test failures and has no impact on the scaling numbers.",
