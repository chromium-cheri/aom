      "message": "Hi Yunqing, Marco,\n\nIn this patch, we have appropriately changed the names of a few variables in nonrd pickmode.c. Please note that in order to be consistent with the naming convention followed in the av1_rd_pick_inter_mode() function, the variable comp_pred has been changed/renamed as single_pred. We hope it should be fine.\nThe changes are bit-exact. Please review the patch.\nÂ \nThanks \u0026 Regards,\nAnupam",
